    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Studies of infinite nuclear matter play an important role  in nuclear physics. The aim of this part of the lectures is to provide the necessary ingredients for perfoming studies of neutron star matter (or matter in $\\beta$-equilibrium) and symmetric nuclear matter. We start however with the electron gas in two and three dimensions for both historical and pedagogical reasons. Since there are several benchmark calculations for the electron gas, this small detour will allow us to establish the necessary formalism. Thereafter we will study infinite nuclear matter \n",
    "* at the Hartree-Fock with realistic nuclear forces and\n",
    "\n",
    "* using many-body methods like coupled-cluster theory or in-medium SRG\n",
    "\n",
    "## The infinite electron gas\n",
    "\n",
    "The electron gas is perhaps the only realistic model of a \n",
    "system of many interacting particles that allows for an analytical  solution\n",
    "of the Hartree-Fock equations. Furthermore, to first order in the interaction, one can also\n",
    "obtain an analytical expression for  the total energy and several other properties of a many-particle systems. \n",
    "The model gives a very good approximation to the properties of valence electrons in metals.\n",
    "The assumptions are\n",
    "\n",
    " * System of electrons that is not influenced by external forces except by an attraction provided by a uniform background of ions. These ions give rise to a uniform background charge. The ions are stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    " * The system as a whole is neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    " * We assume we have $N_e$ electrons in a cubic box of length $L$ and volume $\\Omega=L^3$. This volume contains also a uniform distribution of positive charge with density $N_ee/\\Omega$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The homogeneus electron gas is a system of electrons that is not\n",
    "influenced by external forces except by an attraction provided by a\n",
    "uniform background of ions. These ions give rise to a uniform\n",
    "background charge.  The ions are stationary and the system as a whole\n",
    "is neutral.\n",
    "Irrespective of this simplicity, this system, in both two and\n",
    "three-dimensions, has eluded a proper description of correlations in\n",
    "terms of various first principle methods, except perhaps for quantum\n",
    "Monte Carlo methods. In particular, the diffusion Monte Carlo\n",
    "calculations of [Ceperley](http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.45.566) \n",

    "similar to the three-dimensional electron gas can be \n",
    "found in, for example, alkali metals and doped \n",
    "semiconductors. Two-dimensional electron fluids are \n",
    "observed on metal and liquid-helium surfaces, as well as \n",
    "at metal-oxide-semiconductor interfaces. However, the Coulomb \n",

    "densities, the electron gas is better described as a\n",

    "When using, for example, Monte Carlo methods the electron gas must be approximated \n",

For the lowest six energy values the degeneracy in energy gives us $2$, $14$, $38$, $54$, $76$ and $114$ as magic numbers. These numbers will then define our Fermi level when we compute the energy in a Cartesian basis.
