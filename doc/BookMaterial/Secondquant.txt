\section{Introduction and Motivation}
In the \textit{first quantization} formalism of quantum mechanics, one writes many-particle wavefunctions $\Psi(\mathbf{x}_1,\mathbf{x}_2,\dots,\mathbf{x}_N)$ that must be either symmetric (for bosons) or antisymmetric (for fermions) under exchange of any two identical particles. Enforcing these (anti)symmetry requirements in the wavefunction becomes increasingly cumbersome as $N$ grows, with the symmetrization involving $N!$ terms in general. Moreover, the first-quantized approach fixes the particle number $N$, making it awkward to describe situations where the number of particles can vary (as in grand-canonical ensembles or processes of particle creation/annihilation). For these reasons, a new formalism called \textit{second quantization} was developed. In second quantization (also known as the occupation-number representation or Fock space formalism), one shifts the focus from tracking individual particles to describing occupancy of single-particle states. This provides a powerful and elegant linear-algebraic framework for quantum many-body systems, greatly simplifying the treatment of identical particles and automatically incorporating the required symmetrization or antisymmetrization of states.

Historically, the second quantization language was first introduced by Dirac (1927) in the context of quantizing the electromagnetic field, and shortly thereafter applied to many-particle systems by Jordan, Wigner, and Fock. It is now a standard tool in non-relativistic many-body quantum mechanics (especially in condensed matter physics) as well as in quantum field theory. In what follows, we develop the formalism of second quantization from a linear algebra standpoint: we will construct the many-particle Hilbert space (Fock space) as a direct sum of $N$-particle Hilbert spaces, introduce creation and annihilation operators that add or remove particles from states, and show how to represent physical observables (like the Hamiltonian) in this language. We will also work through illustrative examples – the non-interacting Fermi gas, the quantum harmonic oscillator, and spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems – to solidify the concepts.

\section{Many-Particle Hilbert Spaces and Fock Space}
\subsection{Single-Particle and $N$-Particle Hilbert Spaces}
We begin with a single-particle Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}^{(1)}$. This is a complex vector space of dimension (possibly infinite) equal to the number of distinct single-particle quantum states available.  We can choose an orthonormal basis of single-particle states ${| \varphi_{1}\rangle, |\varphi_{2}\rangle, |\varphi_{3}\rangle, \dots }$ spanning $\mathscr{H}^{(1)}$. For example, these basis states could be position eigenstates, momentum eigenstates, energy eigenstates of some single-particle Hamiltonian, or any convenient single-particle basis. For ease of notation, we will often label the basis states with indices or quantum numbers, writing $|\varphi_i\rangle \equiv |i\rangle$ for the $i$th basis state.

The Hilbert space for $N$ distinguishable particles would formally be the $N$-fold tensor product $\mathscr{H}^{(N)}\text{dist} = \mathscr{H}^{(1)} \otimes \mathscr{H}^{(1)} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathscr{H}^{(1)}$ ($N$ factors).  However, if the particles are \textit{identical} (indistinguishable), physical states must live in either the symmetric or antisymmetric subspace of this tensor product. Specifically, for $N$ identical bosons (integer spin), the allowed $N$-particle states form the symmetric subspace $\mathscr{H}^{(N)}{S}$, whereas for $N$ identical fermions (half-integer spin), the states lie in the antisymmetric (completely anti-symmetric) subspace $\mathscr{H}^{(N)}_{A}$. These subspaces are defined by the (anti)symmetry under exchange of any two particle slots. For example, a two-particle basis state $|a\rangle \otimes |b\rangle$ (with $a,b$ labeling single-particle basis kets) can be symmetrized or antisymmetrized as:

Bosons: $|a,b\rangle_{S} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\big(|a\rangle\otimes|b\rangle + |b\rangle\otimes|a\rangle\big)$, which is symmetric under $a\leftrightarrow b$.
Fermions: $|a,b\rangle_{A} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\big(|a\rangle\otimes|b\rangle - |b\rangle\otimes|a\rangle\big)$, which is antisymmetric (changes sign upon exchange). If $a=b$, the bosonic symmetric state $|a,a\rangle_{S} = |a\rangle\otimes|a\rangle$ is allowed (two bosons in the same state $a$), whereas the fermionic “state” $|a,a\rangle_{A}$ is identically zero – reflecting the Pauli exclusion principle that no two fermions can occupy the same single-particle state.


In general, the symmetric $N$-boson subspace $\mathscr{H}^{(N)}{S}$ is spanned by symmetrized $N$-fold tensor products of single-particle basis kets, and the antisymmetric $N$-fermion subspace $\mathscr{H}^{(N)}{A}$ is spanned by antisymmetrized $N$-fold tensor products. The (anti)symmetrization can be viewed as applying a projection operator onto the symmetric or antisymmetric subspace of the full tensor product space. We will notate a generic normalized $N$-particle basis state (for either bosons or fermions) as $|i_1, i_2, \dots, i_N \rangle$, meaning that one particle is in single-particle state $|i_1\rangle$, another in $|i_2\rangle$, etc. For fermions, all $i_1,\dots,i_N$ must be distinct (no repetition), whereas for bosons some of the $i$’s can be equal (with appropriate symmetric normalization).

\subsection{Fock Space Construction}
The total Hilbert space allowing a variable number of particles is known as the Fock space (after V. Fock). The bosonic Fock space $\mathscr{F}S$ is defined as the direct sum of all $N$-boson symmetric subspaces, and similarly the fermionic Fock space $\mathscr{F}A$ as the direct sum of all $N$-fermion antisymmetric subspaces:
\mathscr{F}{S} \;=\; \bigoplus{N=0}^\infty \mathscr{H}^{(N)}{S}, \qquad \mathscr{F}{A} \;=\; \bigoplus_{N=0}^\infty \mathscr{H}^{(N)}_{A}\,.
Here $N=0$ term is included, corresponding to the vacuum state (no particles).  By convention, there is a unique vacuum state $|,\varnothing\rangle \equiv |0\rangle$ (also sometimes denoted $|\text{vac}\rangle$) which spans $\mathscr{H}^{(0)}$. This vacuum state is symmetric and antisymmetric trivially (since there are no particles to exchange).

A convenient basis for Fock space is the \textit{occupation number basis} or \textit{number states}. We specify a configuration by listing how many particles occupy each single-particle basis state. For instance, given our single-particle basis ${|1\rangle, |2\rangle, |3\rangle, \dots}$, a Fock basis state can be written as
|n_1, n_2, n_3, \dots \rangle,
where $n_j$ is a non-negative integer giving the occupation number of state $|j\rangle$. For bosons, $n_j$ can be any $0,1,2,\dots$ (no upper limit on the number of bosons in one state), while for fermions $n_j \in{0,1}$ (at most one fermion per state due to Pauli exclusion). The state $|n_1,n_2,\dots\rangle$ lives in the $N$-particle sector of Fock space with total particle number $N = \sum_j n_j$. For example, a bosonic three-particle state in a basis of single-particle states might be $|3,0,0,1,0,\dots \rangle$, which indicates there are three particles in state 1 and one particle in state 4 (and thus $N=4$ total in this configuration). For fermions, an example of a five-particle configuration in a certain basis could be $|1,0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,\dots \rangle$, meaning occupations in five distinct states (here $N=5$ and exactly five of the $n_j$’s are 1). The occupation-number notation implicitly represents the required (anti)symmetrization. For instance, the two-boson state $|0,2,0,0,\dots\rangle$ (two bosons in state $|2\rangle$) corresponds to the symmetrized form $|2\rangle \otimes |2\rangle$, whereas a two-fermion state $|0,1,1,0,\dots\rangle$ (one fermion in state 2 and one in state 3) corresponds to the antisymmetric combination $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|2\rangle\otimes|3\rangle - |3\rangle\otimes|2\rangle)$, and a would-be state like $|0,2, …\rangle$ is forbidden for fermions.

The Fock space provides a unified framework to describe states with arbitrary particle number in a single Hilbert space. Importantly, states with different $N$ are orthogonal. The inner product in Fock space is defined so that number states are orthonormal: $\langle n_1,n_2,\dots | m_1,m_2,\dots \rangle = \delta_{n_1,m_1}\delta_{n_2,m_2}\cdots$. In particular, the vacuum $|0\rangle$ is normalized. We also note that Fock space is \emph{separable} (countable basis) if the single-particle space is separable.

\section{Creation and Annihilation Operators}
Central to the second quantization formalism are the ladder operators that add or remove quanta (particles) from states. For each single-particle basis state $|i\rangle$, we introduce a creation operator $\hat{a}^\dagger_i$ and an annihilation operator $\hat{a}_i$. The operator $\hat{a}^\dagger_i$ acts on Fock space to \emph{create} one particle in state $|i\rangle$, while $\hat{a}_i$ \emph{annihilates} (removes) one particle from state $|i\rangle$. These operators are defined by their action on the occupation-number basis states.

First, consider bosons. For any bosonic number state $| \dots, n_i, \dots \rangle$, we define:
\begin{align*}
\hat{a}^\dagger_i , |,\dots, n_i, \dots \rangle &= \sqrt{n_i+1};; |,\dots, n_i+1, \dots \rangle, \
\hat{a}i , |,\dots, n_i, \dots \rangle &= \sqrt{n_i};; |,\dots, n_i-1, \dots \rangle,
\end{align*}
with the understanding that if $n_i=0$ then $\hat{a}i |\dots,0,\dots\rangle = 0$ (you cannot remove a particle from an unoccupied state). In words, $\hat{a}^\dagger_i$ increases the occupancy of state $i$ by one (and multiplies by the normalization factor $\sqrt{n_i+1}$), while $\hat{a}i$ decreases the occupancy by one (with factor $\sqrt{n_i}$). The presence of the square-root factors ensures that these operators are consistent with normalized symmetrized states. Notably, acting on the vacuum, $\hat{a}^\dagger_i |0\rangle = |0,\dots,1_i,\dots,0\rangle$ produces a one-particle state in mode $i$, and $\hat{a}i |0\rangle = 0$ as there is nothing to remove. Repeated application yields multi-particle states: for example,
\hat{a}^\dagger{k_1}\hat{a}^\dagger{k_2}\cdots \hat{a}^\dagger{k_N} |0\rangle = |k_1, k_2, \dots, k_N\rangle \times \sqrt{N!}\,,
so more precisely one has $|k_1, \dots, k_N\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}\hat{a}^\dagger{k_1}\hat{a}^\dagger_{k_2}\cdots \hat{a}^\dagger_{k_N} |0\rangle$. The ordering of the creation operators does not matter for bosons (they commute, as discussed below), and the $1/\sqrt{N!}$ ensures proper normalization of the symmetrized state.

Next, for fermions we define analogous operators $\hat{c}^\dagger_i$ and $\hat{c}i$ (often one uses $a_i, a_i^\dagger$ for both cases, but here we’ll use $c$ to emphasize fermionic anticommutation). Their action is similar in spirit but must include a sign convention to ensure antisymmetric behavior. One convenient definition on the occupation basis (assuming a fixed ordering of single-particle basis states) is:
\begin{align*}
\hat{c}^\dagger\nu , |,\dots, n_\nu, \dots \rangle &= (-1)^{\sum_{\mu<\nu} n_\mu},(1 - n_\nu); |,\dots, 1_\nu, \dots \rangle, \
\hat{c}\nu , |,\dots, n\nu, \dots \rangle &= (-1)^{\sum_{\mu<\nu} n_\mu},n_\nu; |,\dots, 0_\nu, \dots \rangle~,
\end{align*}
where $n_\nu\in{0,1}$. In essence, $\hat{c}^\dagger_\nu$ will create a fermion in state $\nu$ only if that state is currently unoccupied ($1-n_\nu$ ensures the Pauli principle by giving zero if $n_\nu=1$), and $\hat{c}\nu$ will annihilate a fermion from state $\nu$ only if that state is occupied ($n\nu$ factor ensures zero if $n_\nu=0$). The factor $(-1)^{\sum_{\mu<\nu} n_\mu}$ is a phase (either $+1$ or $-1$) equal to $(-1)^{N_{\text{occ}}}$ where $N_{\text{occ}}$ is the number of occupied states with index less than $\nu$; this phase factor is needed to reproduce the correct antisymmetric sign upon exchanging fermions and depends on an arbitrary but fixed ordering of the single-particle basis states. The precise choice of ordering convention is ultimately irrelevant for final physical predictions, but it ensures that multi-fermion states constructed by $\hat{c}^\dagger$ operators automatically come out antisymmetric. For example, starting from the vacuum,
\hat{c}^\dagger_{i_1}\hat{c}^\dagger_{i_2}\cdots \hat{c}^\dagger_{i_N} |0\rangle = |i_1, i_2, \dots, i_N\rangle_A,
an $N$-fermion antisymmetric state (up to an overall sign depending on the chosen ordering of indices $i_1,\dots,i_N$). By convention we often take $i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_N$ (sorted) so that the state is created with a definite phase. Unlike the bosonic case, one does \emph{not} divide by $\sqrt{N!}$ here because the anti-commutation automatically yields orthonormal states (creation operators anticommute, so any overlap of identical creation orderings produces zero unless the sequences are identical up to permutation, in which case a permutation of operators yields a sign but not a combinatorial multiplicity). In short, fermionic creation operators inherently incorporate the normalization for antisymmetric states.

\subsection{Commutation and Anticommutation Relations}
The algebraic properties of the ladder operators are summarized by their commutation or anticommutation relations. For bosons, any two creation or annihilation operators commute, while annihilation and creation operators obey the canonical commutation relations (CCR):
[\hat{a}_i,\; \hat{a}_j] = 0, \qquad [\hat{a}_i^\dagger,\; \hat{a}j^\dagger] = 0, \qquad [\hat{a}i,\; \hat{a}j^\dagger] = \delta{ij}~.
Here $[X,Y] \equiv X Y - Y X$, and $\delta{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta (so $\delta{ij}=1$ if $i=j$, else 0). These commutation relations can be derived from the action of $a, a^\dagger$ on number states given earlier. They essentially encode the fact that exchanging two bosons yields no sign change. Indeed, $\hat{a}_i \hat{a}j^\dagger |0\rangle$ produces a one-particle state $|j\rangle$ if $i=j$, or two distinct particles if $i\neq j$, and the commutator picks up a delta ensuring the correct result on any state . The last relation $[a_i, a_j^\dagger] = \delta{ij}$ also implies $\hat{a}i |0\rangle$ is zero (since if we let $j=i$ in that relation and have it act on $|0\rangle$, the left side gives $a_i a_i^\dagger|0\rangle - a_i^\dagger a_i|0\rangle = a_i a_i^\dagger|0\rangle$ because $a_i|0\rangle=0$, and the right side gives $\delta{ii}|0\rangle = |0\rangle$, so $a_i a_i^\dagger|0\rangle = |0\rangle$, meaning $a_i a_i^\dagger$ acting on vacuum yields one particle in state $i$). It also follows that $\hat{a}_i^\dagger |0\rangle$ is normalized: $\langle0| a_i a_i^\dagger |0\rangle = 1$. We note that the bosonic commutation relations are identical in form to those of the standard quantum harmonic oscillator ladder operators, which is no coincidence – a single bosonic mode is mathematically equivalent to a harmonic oscillator (with $[a, a^\dagger]=1$) .

For fermions, the creation/annihilation operators obey Fermi–Dirac statistics encoded by anticommutation relations (CAR):
\{\hat{c}_i,\; \hat{c}_j\} = 0, \qquad \{\hat{c}_i^\dagger,\; \hat{c}_j^\dagger\} = 0, \qquad \{\hat{c}_i,\; \hat{c}j^\dagger\} = \delta{ij}~.
Here ${X,Y} = X Y + Y X$. These mean that exchanging two fermionic operators introduces a minus sign (anticommutation): $\hat{c}_i \hat{c}_j = - \hat{c}_j \hat{c}_i$, etc. In particular, $\hat{c}_i^2 = 0$ and $(\hat{c}_i^\dagger)^2 = 0$, which reflects that one cannot create or annihilate two identical fermions in the same state (Pauli principle). The mixed anticommutator ${\hat{c}_i, \hat{c}j^\dagger} = \delta{ij}$ plays the role analogous to the delta-function commutator for bosons . These relations can likewise be derived from the explicit action of $c, c^\dagger$ on the occupation basis (with the phase convention as given). They ensure, for example, that $\hat{c}_i^\dagger|0\rangle$ is a normalized one-fermion state and $\hat{c}_i |0\rangle = 0$.

To summarize: bosonic operators satisfy the Heisenberg–Weyl algebra of harmonic oscillator modes, while fermionic operators satisfy a Clifford algebra (sometimes called the fermionic algebra) with nilpotency ($a_i^2=0$). The two cases are often collectively written as:
\hat{a}_i \hat{a}_j^\dagger \pm \hat{a}_j^\dagger \hat{a}i = \delta{ij},
where the $+$ sign is for fermions (anticommutator) and $-$ for bosons (commutator). In practical terms, one can treat the algebra of $\hat{a},\hat{a}^\dagger$ as an operator realization of the symmetric/antisymmetric laddering structure of Fock space.

\paragraph{Number operators and number states:} For each single-particle mode $i$, we define the number operator $\hat{n}_i = \hat{a}_i^\dagger \hat{a}_i$ (for bosons) or $\hat{n}_i = \hat{c}_i^\dagger \hat{c}_i$ (for fermions). From the commutation/anticommutation relations, one can show that $\hat{n}_i$ has eigenvalues $0,1,2,\dots$ (boson) or $0,1$ (fermion) and that
\hat{n}_i \, |\,\dots, n_i, \dots \rangle = n_i \; |\,\dots, n_i, \dots \rangle.
That is, $|n_1,n_2,\dots\rangle$ is an eigenstate of each $\hat{n}_i$ with eigenvalue $n_i$. In fact, $\hat{n}_i$ acting on a state just yields the occupation number of mode $i$ in that state. The total particle number operator is $\hat{N} = \sum_i \hat{n}_i$; clearly $\hat{N}|n_1,n_2,\dots\rangle = (\sum_i n_i)|n_1,n_2,\dots\rangle = N |n_1,n_2,\dots\rangle$. In the formalism of second quantization, $\hat{N}$ generates a $U(1)$ symmetry (global phase rotations of all creation operators) and commutes with the typical many-body Hamiltonians that conserve particle number (we will explicitly see this shortly).

We also note the Hermitian adjoint relationships: $(\hat{a}_i)^\dagger = \hat{a}_i^\dagger$ and $(\hat{c}_i)^\dagger = \hat{c}_i^\dagger$. Creation and annihilation operators for the same mode are thus adjoints of each other (as suggested by the dagger notation). This implies, for example, $\langle \Psi| \hat{a}_i^\dagger |\Phi\rangle = \langle \Psi| (\hat{a}_i)^\dagger |\Phi\rangle = (\langle \Phi| \hat{a}_i |\Psi\rangle)^*$, consistent with usual Dirac adjoint.

\paragraph{Matrix representations (single-mode examples):} It is often illuminating to represent these operators as matrices on small Fock subspaces. For instance, consider a single bosonic mode (like a single harmonic oscillator). The Fock basis is ${|0\rangle, |1\rangle, |2\rangle, \dots}$, and the operators have the well-known infinite-dimensional matrix form:
\hat{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots \\ 0 & 0 & \sqrt{2} & 0 & \cdots \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \sqrt{3} & \cdots \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots \end{pmatrix}, \qquad \hat{a}^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & \cdots \\ 0 & \sqrt{2} & 0 & \cdots \\ 0 & 0 & \sqrt{3} & \ddots \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots \end{pmatrix},
where $\hat{a}$ is lower triangular with entries $\sqrt{n}$ on the sub-diagonal, and $\hat{a}^\dagger$ is upper triangular with $\sqrt{n+1}$ on the super-diagonal. One can verify that indeed $\hat{a}\hat{a}^\dagger - \hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a} = I$ (the identity matrix), which is the matrix form of $[a,a^\dagger]=1$. Similarly, a single fermionic mode has a two-dimensional Fock space spanned by ${|0\rangle, |1\rangle}$. In this basis, the annihilation operator and creation operator can be represented by $2\times2$ matrices
\hat{c} = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\\ 0 & 0\end{pmatrix}, \qquad \hat{c}^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix}0 & 0\\ 1 & 0\end{pmatrix},
since $\hat{c}|1\rangle = |0\rangle$ and $\hat{c}|0\rangle = 0$, while $\hat{c}^\dagger|0\rangle = |1\rangle$, $\hat{c}^\dagger|1\rangle=0$. Indeed, these satisfy ${\hat{c},\hat{c}^\dagger} = \hat{c}\hat{c}^\dagger + \hat{c}^\dagger\hat{c} = I = \begin{pmatrix}1&0\0&1\end{pmatrix}$ and $\hat{c}^2 = {\hat{c}^\dagger}^2 = 0$, matching the fermionic algebra.

\section{Second-Quantized Hamiltonians and Operators}
Any physical observable for a many-particle system can be written in second-quantized form using creation and annihilation operators. As a key example, consider the Hamiltonian (energy operator) for a system of identical particles. In first quantization, the Hamiltonian might be written as $\hat{H} = \sum_{m=1}^N \hat{T}(m) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{m\neq n} \hat{V}(m,n)$, where $\hat{T}$ is a single-particle kinetic energy (and possibly external potential) operator and $\hat{V}$ is a two-particle interaction potential (the factor $1/2$ avoids double counting pairs). We want to express this $\hat{H}$ in terms of $\hat{a},\hat{a}^\dagger$ (for bosons) or $\hat{c},\hat{c}^\dagger$ (for fermions). The general result is:

One-body (single-particle) operators: Any operator $\hat{O}$ that acts on one particle at a time (like kinetic energy, or an external potential acting on each particle) can be written as \hat{O}\text{tot} \;=\; \sum{i,j} O_{ij}\; \hat{a}i^\dagger \hat{a}j\,, for bosons or similarly $\sum{ij} O{ij}; \hat{c}_i^\dagger \hat{c}j$ for fermions. Here $O{ij} = \langle i|\hat{O}|j\rangle$ are the matrix elements of the single-particle operator $\hat{O}$ in the chosen single-particle basis ${|i\rangle}$. This formula arises because $\hat{a}_i^\dagger \hat{a}j$ acts by destroying a particle in state $|j\rangle$ and creating one in state $|i\rangle$, thus it has the effect of the one-body operator $\hat{O}$ on the single-particle state $|j\rangle$ summed over all possibilities. For example, the kinetic-plus-potential energy operator $\sum{m=1}^N \hat{T}(m)$ becomes $\hat{H}T = \sum{ij} \langle i|\hat{T}|j\rangle, \hat{a}_i^\dagger \hat{a}_j$ . In a basis where $\hat{T}$ is diagonal (e.g. plane-wave momentum eigenstates for free kinetic energy, or energy eigenstates in a potential), this reduces to $\sum_k \epsilon_k, \hat{a}_k^\dagger \hat{a}_k$, which simply says we sum the energy $\epsilon_k$ for each occupied state $k$.
Two-body interactions: A general two-particle interaction $\hat{V}(m,n)$ (symmetric under exchange of the two particles) can be expressed as \hat{H}V \;=\; \frac{1}{2} \sum{i,j,k,l} V_{ij;kl}\; \hat{a}_i^\dagger \hat{a}_j^\dagger\, \hat{a}_l\, \hat{a}k~, with $V{ij;kl} = \langle i,j | \hat{V} | k, l \rangle$ being the (anti)symmetrized two-particle matrix element for the interaction . Here $\hat{a}_i^\dagger \hat{a}_j^\dagger \hat{a}_l \hat{a}k$ means “destroy a particle in state $k$ and one in state $l$, then create one in state $i$ and one in state $j$”. The $\frac{1}{2}$ compensates the double counting of $i,j$ vs $k,l$ pairs (and for fermions, note that $V{ij;kl}$ should incorporate the antisymmetry of the two-particle states, but the operator form with anticommuting $c$’s automatically handles the sign). For example, if $\hat{V}(m,n)$ is an interaction potential between particles (like Coulomb interaction for electrons), one often writes $\hat{H}V = \frac{1}{2}\sum{i,j,k,l} \langle i,j|V|k,l\rangle, \hat{c}_i^\dagger \hat{c}_j^\dagger \hat{c}_l \hat{c}_k$ for fermions (with $i,j,k,l$ including spin indices as well, typically).


Thus, the full many-body Hamiltonian in second quantization is
\hat{H} \;=\; \sum_{i,j} \langle i|T|j\rangle\, \hat{a}_i^\dagger \hat{a}j \;\;+\;\; \frac{1}{2} \sum{i,j,k,l} \langle i,j|V|k,l\rangle\, \hat{a}_i^\dagger \hat{a}_j^\dagger \hat{a}_l \hat{a}_k~,
and analogously for fermions (just interpret $a$ as $c$ and commutators replaced by anticommutators in their algebra). In these formulas, the normal ordering of operators (annihilators to the right of creators) is important. The term $\hat{a}_i^\dagger \hat{a}_j$ is already normal-ordered. In $\hat{a}_i^\dagger \hat{a}_j^\dagger \hat{a}_l \hat{a}_k$, the annihilation operators $\hat{a}_l, \hat{a}k$ are to the right, which is the standard normal-ordered form. Normal ordering ensures that the matrix elements like $V{ij;kl}$ can be taken as fully symmetric (or antisymmetric) without overcounting.

As a check, one can verify that the particle-number operator $\hat{N} = \sum_i \hat{a}_i^\dagger \hat{a}_i$ commutes with $\hat{H}$, as expected for a theory with particle number conservation. Indeed, $[\hat{N}, \hat{H}T]=0$ and $[\hat{N}, \hat{H}V]=0$ can be shown using the (anti)commutation relations . If one wanted to allow particle-nonconserving terms (as in certain effective theories or superconductivity models), one could add terms like $\frac{1}{2}\sum{ij}\Delta{ij} a_i^\dagger a_j^\dagger + \text{h.c.}$ which create or destroy pairs, but we will not consider those in this context.

Finally, it is worth mentioning the concept of field operators in second quantization. If ${\phi_i(\mathbf{r})}$ is the single-particle wavefunction basis (e.g. position eigenfunctions or some mode functions), one can define a field annihilation operator in real space as $\hat{\psi}(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_i \phi_i(\mathbf{r}), \hat{a}_i$. This $\hat{\psi}(\mathbf{r})$ annihilates a particle at position $\mathbf{r}$ (for bosons, or creates a hole for fermions) and its adjoint $\hat{\psi}^\dagger(\mathbf{r})$ creates a particle at $\mathbf{r}$. These field operators satisfy equal-time commutation or anticommutation relations corresponding to delta-function locality. The Hamiltonian can also be written in terms of $\hat{\psi}^\dagger(\mathbf{r})$ and $\hat{\psi}(\mathbf{r})$ as integrals (recovering the usual field theory form), but for our lecture-note scope, the mode sum representation given above is sufficient.

\section{Examples in Second Quantization}
We now illustrate the formalism with a few important examples.

\subsection{Non-Interacting Fermi Gas (Fermi Sea)}
As a first example, consider $N$ non-interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fermions (e.g. electrons without Coulomb interaction) confined in a volume $V$ with periodic boundary conditions. The single-particle eigenstates can be taken as plane waves labeled by momentum $\mathbf{p}$ and spin $\sigma \in {\uparrow,\downarrow}$. The single-particle energies are $\varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}} = \frac{\hbar^2 |\mathbf{p}|^2}{2m}$ (parabolic dispersion). In second quantized form, the Hamiltonian is
\hat{H} \;=\; \sum_{\mathbf{p},\,\sigma} \varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}}\; \hat{c}{\mathbf{p},\sigma}^\dagger \hat{c}{\mathbf{p},\sigma}\,,
since there are no interactions ($H_V=0$) and $\langle \mathbf{p},\sigma |T| \mathbf{q},\sigma’\rangle = \varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}}, \delta_{\mathbf{p}\mathbf{q}}\delta_{\sigma\sigma’}$. This describes a set of independent fermionic modes (one for each $(\mathbf{p},\sigma)$). The ground state (at zero temperature) is obtained by filling the lowest $N$ single-particle states with fermions, consistent with the Pauli principle. If we assume $N$ is large, the occupied states will form a Fermi sphere in momentum space: all states with $|\mathbf{p}|$ less than the Fermi momentum $p_F$ are occupied (two fermions per momentum, one per spin), and all higher momentum states are empty. In the thermodynamic limit, $p_F$ is defined by $N = 2 \sum_{|\mathbf{p}|<p_F} 1$. The ground state in second quantization can be written compactly as
|\Psi_{0}\rangle \;=\; \prod_{|\mathbf{p}|<p_F,\,\sigma} \hat{c}_{\mathbf{p},\sigma}^\dagger \;|0\rangle\,,
i.e. a product of creation operators filling every mode inside the Fermi surface. This state is often called the Fermi sea. For example, if we had a finite system with discrete levels, one could label the energy-ordered single-particle orbitals as $i=1,2,3,\dots$ and the $N$-fermion ground state is $|1,1, \dots,1,0,0,\dots\rangle$ (with $n_i=1$ for the $N$ lowest $i$ and 0 for the rest).

One can easily compute the expectation values of number operators in this ground state: $\langle \Psi_0| \hat{c}{\mathbf{p},\sigma}^\dagger \hat{c}{\mathbf{p},\sigma} |\Psi_0\rangle = 1$ if $|\mathbf{p}|<p_F$ and $0$ if $|\mathbf{p}|>p_F$. In other words, $\langle n_{\mathbf{p},\sigma}\rangle = 1$ for occupied modes and 0 for empty modes, which is the characteristic step-function occupation of a zero-temperature Fermi gas. The total energy can be obtained by summing $\varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}}$ over all occupied states (recovering the well-known formula $E_0 = \sum_{|\mathbf{p}|<p_F} \varepsilon_{\mathbf{p}}$). Low-energy excited states of this Fermi gas are obtained by promoting fermions from inside the Fermi sea to previously unoccupied states above the Fermi surface – in second quantization language, an excitation is created by an operator like $\hat{c}{\mathbf{p},\sigma}^\dagger \hat{c}{\mathbf{q},\sigma’}$ acting on $|\Psi_0\rangle$, which removes a particle from a filled state $\mathbf{q}$ and puts one in an empty state $\mathbf{p}$. Such excitations are combinations of a fermion (particle) added above $p_F$ and a fermion (hole) removed from below $p_F$. This illustrates how second quantization makes it straightforward to describe multiple excitations (by simply applying more operators).

\subsection{Quantum Harmonic Oscillator in Second Quantization}
The quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) is a classic single-particle system, but it can also be viewed through the lens of second quantization as a single bosonic mode. In fact, as noted earlier, the algebra of one bosonic creation/annihilation pair $(a,a^\dagger)$ is exactly the same as the ladder operator algebra for the harmonic oscillator. If we have a harmonic oscillator with Hamiltonian $\hat{H} = \hbar \omega \big(\hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a} + \frac{1}{2}\big)$, the eigenstates are the number states $|n\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n!}}(\hat{a}^\dagger)^n|0\rangle$ (with $n=0,1,2,\dots$) and the energies are $E_n = \hbar\omega(n + \frac{1}{2})$. Here $|0\rangle$ is the oscillator ground state (vacuum state of the mode), and $\hat{a}^\dagger$ acts as a raising operator: $\hat{a}^\dagger |n\rangle = \sqrt{n+1},|n+1\rangle$, $\hat{a}|n\rangle = \sqrt{n},|n-1\rangle$, as discussed before. One can say the QHO’s $n$-phonon state $|n\rangle$ is a Fock state with $n$ bosonic quanta in that single mode.

When we have many independent harmonic oscillators (e.g. normal modes of a lattice vibration, or photon modes in a cavity), second quantization is invaluable. For instance, consider a set of bosonic modes labeled by $k$ (which could be momentum modes of a phonon field). The total Hamiltonian might be $\sum_k \hbar\omega_k (a_k^\dagger a_k + \frac{1}{2})$. The overall ground state is all oscillators in their vacuum, and excitations are created by $a_k^\dagger$ adding one quantum to mode $k$. If we want a state with, say, 3 quanta in mode $p$ and 1 quantum in mode $q$, we simply write $|(n_p=3,, n_q=1,\dots)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3!1!}} (a_p^\dagger)^3 (a_q^\dagger)^1 |0\rangle$. The factorials again take care of bosonic normalization. One sees that the formalism naturally generalizes the single-oscillator ladder method to any number of modes.

Another perspective: the second-quantized formalism for the harmonic oscillator is sometimes introduced even in elementary quantum mechanics courses, without calling it “second quantization.” For example, when solving the QHO, one introduces $a$ and $a^\dagger$ to avoid dealing with the differential equation directly, thereby deriving energies and eigenstates algebraically. In that context, $a^\dagger$ was effectively a creation operator adding one quantum of energy $\hbar\omega$. In field theory, we would say each quantized normal mode of the field is a harmonic oscillator, and $a_k^\dagger$ creates one excitation in that mode (e.g. one photon of momentum $k$ if quantizing an electromagnetic field mode). In summary, the harmonic oscillator provides a concrete realization of bosonic commutation relations and shows how Fock space (with its infinite ladder of states) emerges from a simple mode.

\subsection{Spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ Systems and the Jordan–Wigner Transformation}
Spin systems (collections of spins on lattices) can also be related to second quantization. Although spins are not particles, a two-level spin-$1/2$ at a site can be mapped to a fermionic occupancy of that site (0 or 1). Consider a single spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, with basis $|\downarrow\rangle$ and $|\uparrow\rangle$. We can define a fictitious fermion such that the vacuum state $|0\rangle$ corresponds to spin down ($|\downarrow\rangle$) and the one-particle state $|1\rangle = c^\dagger|0\rangle$ corresponds to spin up ($|\uparrow\rangle$). The fermionic creation and annihilation operators for this mode (let’s call them $f^\dagger, f$ to avoid confusion with physical electrons) then satisfy ${f,f^\dagger}=1$. We can express the spin operators in terms of $f, f^\dagger$. The raising and lowering spin operators $S^+ = | \uparrow \rangle\langle \downarrow |$ and $S^- = | \downarrow \rangle\langle \uparrow |$ can be identified with $f^\dagger$ and $f$ (up to phase conventions). In fact, one convenient representation is:
S^+ = f^\dagger, \qquad S^- = f, \qquad S^z = \frac{1}{2}\big(|\uparrow\rangle\langle\uparrow| - |\downarrow\rangle\langle\downarrow|\big) = \frac{1}{2}(f^\dagger f - f f^\dagger) = f^\dagger f - \frac{1}{2},
in the subspace of one spin. Here $f^\dagger f$ is the number operator giving 1 for $|\uparrow\rangle$ and 0 for $|\downarrow\rangle$, so $S^z = \frac{1}{2}(1$ for up minus $1$ for down$)$ as expected. The transverse spin components become
S^x = \frac{1}{2}(S^+ + S^-) = \frac{1}{2}(f^\dagger + f), \qquad S^y = \frac{1}{2i}(S^+ - S^-) = \frac{1}{2i}(f^\dagger - f),
which indeed satisfy the $su(2)$ algebra for spin operators . Thus, a spin-$1/2$ can be regarded as a fermionic mode with occupation 0 or 1 representing the two spin states . (This mapping is sometimes called a Jordan–Wigner transformation in 0 dimensions, or simply a fermionic representation of a spin.)

For a system of many spins (say a chain of $L$ spin-$1/2$ sites), one can extend this idea by assigning a fermionic operator $(f_j, f_j^\dagger)$ to each site $j$, such that $f_j^\dagger |0\rangle_j = |\uparrow\rangle_j$ and $|0\rangle_j$ corresponds to spin down at site $j$. However, a complication arises: physical spin operators on different sites commute ($[S^a_i, S^b_j]=0$ for $i\neq j$ since they act on different subsystems), whereas the naive fermion operators on different sites anticommute (${f_i, f_j^\dagger} = 0$ for $i\neq j$). We can still achieve a consistent mapping in one dimension by introducing nonlocal phase factors (strings) to adjust the signs. The Jordan–Wigner transformation provides a recipe:
S^+j = f_j^\dagger \,\exp\!\Big(i\pi \sum{l<j} f_l^\dagger f_l\Big), \qquad S^-j = \exp\!\Big(i\pi \sum{l<j} f_l^\dagger f_l\Big)\, f_j~,
with $S^z_j = f_j^\dagger f_j - \frac{1}{2}$ . The exponential string (phase factor) $\exp(i\pi\sum_{l<j} n_l)$, where $n_l = f_l^\dagger f_l$, essentially counts the parity of fermions to the left of site $j$ and gives a $-1$ sign if an odd number of fermions are to the left. This extra phase ensures that two different spin operators on distant sites commute as they should (because the anticommutation of fermions yields a minus sign that is canceled by the string’s minus sign when exchanging two spins). In one dimension, this transformation maps a spin chain to a system of spinless fermions on a chain with nearest-neighbor couplings turning into hopping terms for the fermions . For example, the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ $XY$ model or transverse-field Ising model can be exactly transformed into free or almost-free fermions using Jordan–Wigner. As a concrete case, the Heisenberg $XX$ Hamiltonian on a chain, $H = J \sum_{j}(S^+j S^-{j+1} + S^-j S^+{j+1})$, becomes $H = J \sum_j (f_j^\dagger f_{j+1} + f_{j+1}^\dagger f_j)$ in fermion language (a tight-binding hopping model). The $S^z_i S^z_{i+1}$ interaction in the Heisenberg $XXX$ model becomes a density–density (interaction) term $f_i^\dagger f_i f_{i+1}^\dagger f_{i+1}$ in fermion form, which is non-local beyond nearest neighbors after JW due to the string, making the full Heisenberg model an interacting fermion model (the so-called Fermi–Hubbard chain in a certain limit).

The main takeaway from this example is that second quantization techniques are not limited to literal particles moving in space – they can be applied to other quantum many-body systems, such as spins, by mapping the two-level degree of freedom to an occupation number. In larger spin representations (spin-$S$), one can similarly use bosonic representations (e.g. the Holstein–Primakoff or Schwinger boson method) to map spin operators to boson creation/annihilation operators (with constraints). These mappings allow one to utilize the powerful creation-annihilation operator formalism and diagrammatic techniques even for quantum magnetism problems.

Conclusion: We have developed the formal structure of second quantization for non-relativistic many-body quantum mechanics, emphasizing a linear-algebraic viewpoint. The Fock space construction and the ladder operators $\hat{a},\hat{a}^\dagger$ (for bosons) or $\hat{c},\hat{c}^\dagger$ (for fermions) allow us to elegantly build many-particle states and encode the symmetrization postulate. We derived the fundamental (anti)commutation relations and showed how to represent general operators, especially the Hamiltonian, in this formalism. The examples of the Fermi gas, harmonic oscillator, and spin systems illustrate how second quantization simplifies the description of otherwise complicated many-body states (Fermi sea, multi-phonon states, spin chains, etc.) . Armed with these tools, one can move on to more advanced topics such as perturbation theory, Green’s functions, and beyond, where the second-quantized language is indispensable. The formalism we discussed here is also the stepping stone to quantum field theory, in which fields are represented by operator-valued distributions creating and annihilating particles (the “third quantization” is a myth – second quantization is as far as it goes!).
