===== Measurements =====

The probability of a measurement on a quantum system giving a certain
result is determined by the weight of the relevant basis state in the
state vector. After the measurement, the system is in a state that
corresponds to the result of the measurement. The operators and
gates discussed below are examples of operations we can perform on
specific states.


We  consider the state
!bt
\[
\vert \psi\rangle = \alpha \vert 0 \rangle +\beta \vert 1 \rangle
\]
!et

!split
===== Properties of a measurement =====

o A measurement can yield only one of the above states, either $\vert 0\rangle$ or $\vert 1\rangle$.
o The probability of a measurement resulting in $\vert 0\rangle$ is $\alpha^*\alpha = \vert \alpha \vert^2$.
o The probability of a measurement resulting in $\vert 1\rangle$ is $\beta^*\beta = \vert \beta \vert^2$.
o And we note that the sum of the outcomes gives $\alpha^*\alpha+\beta^*\beta=1$ since the two states are normalized.

After the measurement, the state of the system is the state associated with the result of the measurement.

We have already encountered the projection operators $P$ and $Q$. Let
us now look at other types of operations we can make on qubit states.




!split
===== Entanglement  ===== 


In order to study entanglement and why it is so important for quantum
computing, we need to introduce some basic measures and useful
quantities.  These quantities are the spectral decomposition of
hermitian operators, how these are then used to define measurements
and how we can define so-called density operators (matrices). These
are all quantities which will become very useful when we discuss
entanglement and in particular how to quantify it. In order to define
these quantities we need first to remind ourselves about some basic linear
algebra properties of hermitian operators and matrices.

!split
===== Basic properties of hermitian operators =====

The operators we typically encounter in quantum mechanical studies are
o Hermitian (self-adjoint) meaning that for example the elements of a Hermitian matrix $\bm{U}$ obey $u_{ij}=u_{ji}^*$.
o Unitary $\bm{U}\bm{U}^{\dagger}=\bm{U}^{\dagger}\bm{U}=\bm{I}$, where $\bm{I}$ is the unit matrix
o The oparator $\bm{U}$ and its self-adjoint commute (often labeled as normal operators), that is  $[\bm{U},\bm{U}^{\dagger}]=0$. An operator is _normal_ if and only if it is diagonalizable. A Hermitian operator is normal.

Unitary operators in a Hilbert space preserve the norm and orthogonality. If $\bm{U}$ is a unitary operator acting on a state $\vert \psi_j\rangle$, the action of

!bt
\[
\vert \phi_i\rangle=\bm{U}\vert \psi_j\rangle,
\]
!et
preserves both the norm and orthogonality, that is $\langle \phi_i \vert \phi_j\rangle=\langle \psi_i \vert \psi_j\rangle=\delta_{ij}$, as discussed earlier.

!split
===== The Pauli matrices again =====

As example, consider the Pauli matrix $\sigma_x$. We have already seen that this matrix is a unitary matrix. Consider then an orthogonal and normalized basis $\vert 0\rangle^{\dagger} =\begin{bmatrix} 1 &  0\end{bmatrix}$ and $\vert 1\rangle^{\dagger} =\begin{bmatrix} 0 &  1\end{bmatrix}$ and a state which is a linear superposition of these two basis states

!bt
\[
\vert \psi_a\rangle=\alpha_0\vert 0\rangle +\alpha_1\vert 1\rangle.
\]
!et

A new state $\vert \psi_b\rangle$ is given by
!bt
\[
\vert \psi_b\rangle=\sigma_x\vert \psi_a\rangle=\alpha_0\vert 1\rangle +\alpha_1\vert 0\rangle.
\]
!et

!split
===== Spectral Decomposition =====

An important technicality which we will use in the discussion of
density matrices, entanglement, quantum entropies and other properties
is the so-called spectral decomposition of an operator.

Let $\vert \psi\rangle$ be a vector in a Hilbert space of dimension $n$ and a hermitian operator $\bm{A}$ defined in this
space. Assume $\vert \psi\rangle$ is an eigenvector of $\bm{A}$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$, that is

!bt
\[
\bm{A}\vert \psi\rangle = \lambda\vert \psi\rangle = \lambda \bm{I}\vert \psi \rangle,
\]
!et
where we used $\bm{I}\vert \psi \rangle = 1 \vert \psi \rangle$.
Subtracting the right hand side from the left hand side gives
!bt
\[
\left[\bm{A}-\lambda \bm{I}\right]\vert \psi \rangle=0,
\]
!et

which has a nontrivial solution only if the determinant
$\mathrm{det}(\bm{A}-\lambda\bm{I})=0$.

!split
===== ONB again and again =====

We define now an orthonormal basis $\vert i \rangle =\{\vert 0
\rangle, \vert 1\rangle, \dots, \vert n-1\rangle$ in the same Hilbert
space. We will assume that this basis is an eigenbasis of $\bm{A}$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_i$

We expand a new vector using this eigenbasis of $\bm{A}$
!bt
\[
\vert \psi \rangle = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i\vert i\rangle,
\]
!et
with the normalization condition $\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\vert \alpha_i\vert^2$.
Acting with $\bm{A}$ on this new state results in

!bt
\[
\bm{A}\vert \psi \rangle = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i\bm{A}\vert i\rangle=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i\lambda_i\vert i\rangle.
\]
!et

!split
===== Projection operators =====

If we then use that the outer product of any state with itself defines a projection operator we have the projection operators
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_{\psi} = \vert \psi\rangle\langle \psi\vert,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_{j} = \vert j\rangle\langle j\vert,
\]
!et
we have that 
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_{j}\vert \psi\rangle=\vert j\rangle\langle j\vert\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i\vert i\rangle=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i\vert j\rangle\langle j\vert i\rangle.
\]
!et

!split
===== Further manipulations =====

This results in
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_{j}\vert \psi\rangle=\alpha_j\vert j\rangle,
\]
!et
since $\langle j\vert i\rangle$.
With the last equation we can rewrite
!bt
\[
\bm{A}\vert \psi \rangle = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i\lambda_i\vert i\rangle=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\lambda_i\bm{P}_i\vert \psi\rangle,
\]
!et
from which we conclude that
!bt
\[
\bm{A}=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\lambda_i\bm{P}_i.
\]
!et

!split
===== Spectral decomposition =====

This is the spectral decomposition of a hermitian and normal
operator. It is true for any state and it is independent of the
basis. The spectral decomposition can in turn be used to exhaustively
specify a measurement, as we will see in the next section.

As an example, consider two states $\vert \psi_a\rangle$ and $\vert
\psi_b\rangle$ that are eigenstates of $\bm{A}$ with eigenvalues
$\lambda_a$ and $\lambda_b$, respectively. In the diagonalization
process we have obtained the coefficients $\alpha_0$, $\alpha_1$,
$\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ using an expansion in terms of the orthogonal
basis $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1\rangle$.

!split
===== Explicit results =====

We have then

!bt
\[
\vert \psi_a\rangle = \alpha_0\vert 0\rangle+\alpha_1\vert 1\rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert \psi_b\rangle = \beta_0\vert 0\rangle+\beta_1\vert 1\rangle,
\]
!et
with corresponding projection operators

!bt
\[
\bm{P}_a=\vert \psi_a\rangle \langle \psi_a\vert = \begin{bmatrix} \vert \alpha_0\vert^2 &\alpha_0\alpha_1^* \\
                                                                   \alpha_1\alpha_0^* & \vert \alpha_1\vert^* \end{bmatrix},
\]    
!et
and
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_b=\vert \psi_b\rangle \langle \psi_b\vert = \begin{bmatrix} \vert \beta_0\vert^2 &\beta_0\beta_1^* \\
                                                                   \beta_1\beta_0^* & \vert \beta_1\vert^* \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

!split
===== The spectral decomposition =====
The results from the previous slide gives us
the following spectral decomposition of $\bm{A}$
!bt
\[
\bm{A}=\lambda_a \vert \psi_a\rangle \langle \psi_a\vert+\lambda_b \vert \psi_b\rangle \langle \psi_b\vert,
\]
!et
which written out in all its details reads
!bt
\[
\bm{A}=\lambda_a\begin{bmatrix} \vert \alpha_0\vert^2 &\alpha_0\alpha_1^* \\
                                                                   \alpha_1\alpha_0^* & \vert \alpha_1\vert^* \end{bmatrix} +\lambda_b\begin{bmatrix} \vert \beta_0\vert^2 &\beta_0\beta_1^* \\
                                                                   \beta_1\beta_0^* & \vert \beta_1\vert^* \end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Measurements =====

Armed with the spectral decomposition, we are now ready to discuss how
to compute measurements of observables.  When we make a measurement,
quantum mechanics postulates that mutually exclusive measurement
outcomes correspond to orthogonal projection operators.

We assume now we can contruct a series of such orthogonal operators based on $\vert i \rangle \in \{\vert 0\rangle, \vert 1\rangle,\dots, \vert n-1\rangle$ computational basis states. These projection operators $\bm{P}_0,\bm{P}_1,\dots,\bm{P}_{n-1}$ are all idempotent and sum to one
!bt
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\bm{P}_i=\bm{I}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Qubit example =====

As an example, consider the basis of two qubits $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1\rangle$ with the correspong sum
!bt
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{1}\bm{P}_i=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
Based on the spectral decomposition discussed above, we can define the probability of eigenvalue $\lambda_i$ as
!bt
\[
\mathrm{Prob}(\lambda_i) = \vert \bm{P}_i\vert \psi\rangle\vert^2,
\]
!et
where $\vert \psi_a\rangle$ is a quantum state representing the system prior to a specific measurement.

!split
===== Total probability =====

We can rewrite this as 
!bt
\[
\mathrm{Prob}(\lambda_i) = \langle \psi\vert \bm{P}_i^{\dagger}\bm{P}_i\vert \psi\rangle =\langle \psi\vert \bm{P}_i\vert \psi\rangle.
\]
!et
The total probability for all measurements is the sum overt all probabilities
!bt
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\mathrm{Prob}(\lambda_i)=1.
\]
!et
We can in turn define the post-measurement normalized pure quantum state as, for the specific outcome $\lambda_i$, as
!bt
\[
\vert \psi'\rangle = \frac{\bm{P}_i\vert \psi\rangle}{\sqrt{\langle \psi \vert \bm{P}_i\vert \psi\rangle}}. 
\]
!et


!split
===== Binary example system =====

As an example, consider the binary system states $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert 1\rangle$ with corresponding projection operators
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_0 =\vert 0 \rangle \langle 0\vert,
\]
!et
and 
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_1 =\vert 1 \rangle \langle 1\vert,
\]
!et
with the properties

!bt
\[
\sum_{i=0}^1\bm{P}_i^{\dagger}\bm{P}_1=\bm{I},
\]
!et

!bt
\[
\bm{P}_0^{\dagger}\bm{P}_0=\bm{P}_0^2=\bm{P}_0,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_1^{\dagger}\bm{P}_1=\bm{P}_1^2=\bm{P}_1.
\]
!et

!split
===== Superposition state =====

Assume thereafter that we have a state $\vert \psi\rangle$ which is a superposition of the above two qubit states
!bt
\[
\vert \psi \rangle = \alpha\vert 0 \rangle + \beta \vert 1\rangle.
\]
!et
The probability of finding either $\vert 0\rangle$ or $\vert 1\rangle$ is then
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_{\psi(0)}=\langle \psi\vert \bm{P}_0^{\dagger}\bm{P}_0\vert \psi\rangle=\vert \alpha\vert^2,
\]
!et
and similarly we have 
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_{\psi(1)}=\langle \psi\vert \bm{P}_1^{\dagger}\bm{P}_1\vert \psi\rangle=\vert \beta\vert^2.
\]
!et
!split
===== More derivations =====

If we set 
!bt
\[
\vert \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\vert 0 \rangle + \vert 1\rangle\right),
\]
!et
we have $\vert \alpha\vert^2=\vert \beta\vert^2=1/2$. In general for this system we have
!bt
\[
\vert \psi'_0\rangle = \frac{\bm{P}_0\vert \psi\rangle}{\sqrt{\langle \psi \vert \bm{P}_0\vert \psi\rangle}}=\frac{\alpha}{\vert \alpha\vert}\vert 0 \rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert \psi'_1\rangle = \frac{\bm{P}_1\vert \psi\rangle}{\sqrt{\langle \psi \vert \bm{P}_1\vert \psi\rangle}}=\frac{\beta}{\vert \beta\vert}\vert 1 \rangle. 
\]
!et

!split
===== Final result =====
In general we have that 
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_{\psi(x)}=\langle \psi\vert \bm{P}_x^{\dagger}\bm{P}_x\vert \psi\rangle,,
\]
!et
which we can rewrite as
!bt
\[
\mathrm{Prob}(\psi(x))=\mathrm{Tr}\left[\bm{P}_x^{\dagger}\bm{P}_x\vert \psi\rangle\langle \psi\vert\right].
\]
!et

!split
===== Example =====

The last equation can be understood better through the following example with a state $\vert \psi\rangle$

!bt
\[
\vert \psi \rangle = \alpha \vert 0\rangle+\beta \vert 1\rangle,
\]
!et
which results in a projection operator
!bt
\[
\vert \psi \rangle\langle \psi\vert = \begin{bmatrix} \vert \alpha \vert^2 & \alpha\beta^* \\ \alpha^*\beta & \vert\beta\vert^2\end{bmatrix}.
\]
!et
!split
===== Computing matrix products =====
We have that
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_0^{\dagger}\bm{P}_0=\bm{P}_0=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
and computing the matrix product $\bm{P}_0\vert\psi\rangle\langle \psi\vert$ gives
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_0\vert\psi\rangle\langle \psi\vert=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} \vert \alpha \vert^2 & \alpha\beta^* \\ \alpha^*\beta & \vert\beta\vert^2\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} \vert \alpha \vert^2 & \alpha\beta^* \\ 0 & 0\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
and taking the trace of this matrix, that is computing
!bt
\[
\mathrm{Prob}(\psi(0))=\mathrm{Tr}\left[\bm{P}_0^{\dagger}\bm{P}_0\vert \psi\rangle\langle \psi\vert\right]=\vert \alpha\vert^2,
\]
!et
we obtain the same results as the one we had earlier by computing
the probabliblity for $0$ given by the expression
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_{\psi(0)}=\langle \psi\vert \bm{P}_0^{\dagger}\bm{P}_0\vert \psi\rangle=\vert \alpha\vert^2.
\]
!et

!split
===== Outcome probability =====

It is straight forward to show that
!bt
\[
\mathrm{Prob}(\psi(1))=\mathrm{Tr}\left[\bm{P}_1^{\dagger}\bm{P}_1\vert \psi\rangle\langle \psi\vert\right]=\vert \beta\vert^2,
\]
!et
which we also could have obtained by computing
!bt
\[
\bm{P}_{\psi(1)}=\langle \psi\vert \bm{P}_1^{\dagger}\bm{P}_1\vert \psi\rangle=\vert \beta\vert^2.
\]
!et

We can now extend these expressions to the complete ensemble of measurements. Using the spectral decomposition we have that the probability of an outcome $p(x)$ is
!bt
\[
p(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p_i\bm{P}_{\psi_i(x)},
\]
!et
where $p_i$ are the probabilities of a specific outcome.  Add later a digression on marginal probabilities.

With these prerequisites we are now ready to introduce the density  matrices, or density operators.

!split
===== Density matrices/operators =====

The last equation can be rewritten as 

!bt
\[
p(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p_i\bm{P}_{\psi_i(x)}=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p_i\mathrm{Tr}\left[\bm{P}_x^{\dagger}\bm{P}_x\vert \psi_i\rangle\langle \psi_i\vert\right],
\]
!et
and we define the _density matrix/operator_ as
!bt
\[
\rho=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p_i\vert \psi_i\rangle\langle \psi_i\vert,
\]
!et
we can rewrite the first equation above as 
!bt
\[
p(x)=\mathrm{Tr}\left[\bm{P}_x^{\dagger}\bm{P}_x\rho\right].
\]
!et
If we can define the state of a system in terms of the density matrix, the probability of a specific outcome is then given by
!bt
\[
p(x)_{\rho}=\mathrm{Tr}\left[\bm{P}_x^{\dagger}\bm{P}_x\rho\right].
\]
!et

!split
===== Properties of density matrices =====

A density matrix in a Hilbert space with $n$ states has the following properties (which we state without proof)
o There exists a probability $p_i\geq 0$ with $\sum_ip_i=1$,
o There exists an orthonormal basis $\psi_i$ such that we can define $\rho=\sum_ip_i\vert\psi_i\rangle\langle \psi_i\vert$,
o We have $0 \leq \rho^2\leq 1$ and
o The norm $\vert\vert \rho \vert\vert_2\leq 1$.

With the density matrix we can also define the state the system collapses to after a measurement, namely

!bt
\[
\rho'_x=\frac{\bm{P}_x\rho\bm{P}_x^{\dagger}}{\mathrm{Tr}[\bm{P}_x^{\dagger}\bm{P}_x\rho]}.
\]
!et


!split
===== Representation of states and Hamiltonians =====


Before we proceed we need several other definitions.  Throughout these
lectures we will assume that the interacting part of the Hamiltonian
can be approximated by a two-body interaction.  This means that our
Hamiltonian can be written as the sum of a onebody part, which
includes kinetic energy and an eventual external field, and a twobody
interaction




!bt
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H} = \hat{H}_0 + \hat{H}_I 
    = \sum_{i=1}^N \hat{h}_0(x_i) + \sum_{i < j}^N \hat{v}(r_{ij}),
\end{equation}
!et
with the onebody part 
!bt
\begin{equation}
  H_0=\sum_{i=1}^N \hat{h}_0(x_i).
label{hinuclei}
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== Typical onebody Hamiltonians =====

The onebody part $u_{\mathrm{ext}}(x_i)$ is normally approximated by a
harmonic oscillator potential or the Coulomb interaction an electron
feels from the nucleus. However, other potentials are fully possible,
such as one derived from the self-consistent solution of the
Hartree-Fock equations or density functional theories.


!split
===== Symmetries =====
Our Hamiltonian is invariant under the permutation (interchange) of
two particles.  Since we deal with fermions however, the total wave
function is antisymmetric.  Let $\hat{P}$ be an operator which
interchanges two particles.  Due to the symmetries we have ascribed to
our Hamiltonian, this operator commutes with the total Hamiltonian,

!bt 
\[
[\hat{H},\hat{P}] = 0,
 \]
!et
meaning that $\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots , x_N)$ is an eigenfunction of 
$\hat{P}$ as well, that is
!bt 
\[
\hat{P}_{ij}\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_N)=
\beta\Psi_{\lambda}(x_1, x_2, \dots,x_i,\dots,x_j,\dots,x_N),
\]
!et
where $\beta$ is the eigenvalue of $\hat{P}$. We have introduced the suffix $ij$ in order to indicate that we permute particles $i$ and $j$. The variable $N$ refers to the number of particles.
The Pauli principle tells us that the total wave function for a system of fermions
has to be antisymmetric, resulting in the eigenvalue $\beta = -1$.   The variable $N$ represents the number of particles.

!split
===== Fermions =====
If we deal with fermions, we assume that  we can approximate the exact eigenfunction with a Slater determinant
!bt
\begin{equation}
   \Phi(x_1, x_2,\dots ,x_N,\alpha,\beta,\dots, \sigma)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}
\left| \begin{array}{ccccc} \psi_{\alpha}(x_1)& \psi_{\alpha}(x_2)& \dots & \dots & \psi_{\alpha}(x_N)\\
                            \psi_{\beta}(x_1)&\psi_{\beta}(x_2)& \dots & \dots & \psi_{\beta}(x_N)\\  
                            \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
                            \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
                     \psi_{\sigma}(x_1)&\psi_{\sigma}(x_2)& \dots & \dots & \psi_{\sigma}(x_N)\end{array} \right|, label{eq:HartreeFockDet}
\end{equation}
!et
where  $x_i$  stand for the coordinates and spin values of a particle $i$ and $\alpha,\beta,\dots, \gamma$ 
are quantum numbers needed to describe remaining quantum numbers.  
This ansatz for the computational basis is often based on single-particle functions which are eigenfunctions of a part of the total Hamiltonian. Most frequently, these single-particle basis functions are eigenpairs of the non-interacting part of the Hamiltonian (normally defined by kinetic and external potential operators).

!split
===== Ansatz for states =====


For Fermions (identical and indistinguishable particles) we will 
form an ansatz for a given state in terms of so-called Slater determinants determined
by a chosen basis of single-particle functions. 

For a given $n\times n$ matrix $\mathbf{A}$ we can write its determinant
!bt
\[
   det(\mathbf{A})=|\mathbf{A}|=
\left| \begin{array}{ccccc} a_{11}& a_{12}& \dots & \dots & a_{1n}\\
                            a_{21}&a_{22}& \dots & \dots & a_{2n}\\  
                            \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
                            \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
                            a_{n1}& a_{n2}& \dots & \dots & a_{nn}\end{array} \right|,
\]
!et
in a more compact form as 
!bt
\[
|\mathbf{A}|= \sum_{i=1}^{n!}(-1)^{p_i}\hat{P}_i a_{11}a_{22}\dots a_{nn},
\]
!et
where $\hat{P}_i$ is a permutation operator which permutes the column indices $1,2,3,\dots,n$
and the sum runs over all $n!$ permutations.  The quantity $p_i$ represents the number of transpositions of column indices that are needed in order to bring a given permutation back to its initial ordering, in our case given by $a_{11}a_{22}\dots a_{nn}$ here.


!split
===== Simple fermionic example =====
A simple $2\times 2$ determinant illustrates this. We have
!bt
\[
   det(\mathbf{A})=
\left| \begin{array}{cc} a_{11}& a_{12}\\
                            a_{21}&a_{22}\end{array} \right|= (-1)^0a_{11}a_{22}+(-1)^1a_{12}a_{21},
\]
!et

where in the last term we have interchanged the column indices $1$ and
$2$. The natural ordering we have chosen is $a_{11}a_{22}$.



!split
===== Using an ONB =====
We define our new single-particle basis (this is a normal approach for
Hartree-Fock theory) by performing a unitary transformation on our
previous basis (labelled with greek indices) as
!bt
\[
\vert \psi\rangle_i  = \sum_{j} u_{ij}\vert \phi\rangle_j.

If the basis has infinitely many solutions, we need to truncate the
above sum.  We assume that the basis $\vert\phi\rangle_j$ is
orthogonal.

If we stay with determinants, a feature which will become useful is to
expand a new determinant in terms of a previous one that is defined by
a given set of single-particle state functions.  As discussed above,
we can define a new basis that is a linear combination of another
basis (assumed to be orthogonal and normalized).  This means that if
the coefficients $u_{ij}$ belong to a unitary or orthogonal
orthogonality is preserved, as discussed above.

This propertry is extremely useful when we build up a basis of many-body Stater determinant based states.

===== Simple  Hamiltonian models =====



In order to study get started with coding, we will study two simple Hamiltonian systems, one which we can use for a single qubit systems and one which has as basis functions a two-qubit system. These two simple Hamiltonians exhibit also something which is called level crossing, a feature which we will use in later studies of entanglement.

We study first a simple two-level system. Thereafter we
extend our model to a four-level system which can be
interpreted as composed of two separate (not necesseraly identical)
subsystems.

We let our hamiltonian depend linearly on a strength parameter $z$

!bt
\[
       H=H_0+\lambda H_\mathrm{I},
\]
!et

with $\lambda \in [0,1]$, where the limits $\lambda=0$ and $\lambda=1$
represent the non-interacting (or unperturbed) and fully interacting
system, respectively.


!split
===== Defining a computational basis =====
The model is an eigenvalue problem with only
two available states, which we label $\vert 0\rangle$ and $\vert
1\rangle$, respectively. Below we will let state $\vert 0 \rangle$
represent the lowest state (often referred to as model-space state)
with its pertinent eigenvalue and eigenvector whereas state $\vert 1\rangle$ represents the eigenvalue of
the excluded space.  The non-interacting solutions to our problem are

!bt
\begin{equation}
       H_0\vert 0 \rangle =\epsilon_0\vert 0 \rangle,
\end{equation}
!et
and
!bt
\begin{equation}
       H_0\vert 1\rangle =\epsilon_1\vert 1\rangle,
\end{equation}
!et

with $\epsilon_0 < \epsilon_1$. We label the off-diagonal matrix
elements $X$, while $X_0=\langle 0 \vert H_I\vert 0 \rangle$ and
$X_1=\langle 1 \vert H_1\vert 1 \rangle$.



!split
===== Analytical solutions  =====
The solution to the  eigenvalue
problem

!bt
label{eq:twolevelH}
\begin{equation}
\left(\begin{array}{cc}\epsilon_0+\lambda X_0 &\lambda X \\
\lambda X &\epsilon_1+\lambda X_1 \end{array}\right)
\end{equation}
!et
yields
!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
     label{eq:exact}
     E(\lambda)=&\frac{1}{2}\left\{\epsilon_0 +\epsilon_1 +\lambda X_0
     +\lambda X_1 \pm \left(
     \epsilon_1 -\epsilon_0 +\lambda X_1-\lambda X_0\right) \right. \\ \nonumber
     & \left. \times\sqrt{1+\frac{4\lambda^2X^2}{\left(
     \epsilon_1 -\epsilon_0 +\lambda X_1-\lambda X_0\right)^2}}
     \right\}.
\end{eqnarray}
!et

!split
===== Numerical examples =====

_For this part we recommend using the jupyter-notebook_.

In the results below we set the parameters $\epsilon_0=0$,
$\epsilon_1=4$, $X_0=-X_1=3$ and $X=0.2$.  This eigenvalue problem can
easily be rewritten in terms of the standard Pauli matrices.  The
non-interacting solutions represent our computational basis.
Pertinent to our choice of parameters, is that at $\lambda\geq 2/3$,
the lowest eigenstate is dominated by $\vert 1\rangle$ while the upper
is $\vert 0 \rangle$. At $\lambda=1$ the $\vert 0 \rangle$ mixing of
the lowest eigenvalue is $1\%$ while for $\lambda\leq 2/3$ we have a
$\vert 0 \rangle$ component of more than $90\%$.  The character of the
eigenvectors has therefore been interchanged when passing $z=2/3$. The
value of the parameter $X$ represents the strength of the coupling
between the model space and the excluded space.  The following code
computes and plots the eigenvalues.

This model exhibits a simple level crossing where the
composition of the final interacting states change character as we
gradually switch on the interaction.



We extend the simple two-level system to a four level
system. This system can be thought of as composed of two subsystems
$A$ and $B$. Each subsystem has computational basis states

!bt
\[
\vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A,B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}^T \hspace{1cm} \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A,B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}^T.
\]
!et
The subsystems could represent single particles or composite many-particle systems of a given symmetry.
This leads to the many-body computational basis states

!bt
\[
\vert 00\rangle = \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert 10\rangle = \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\vert 01\rangle = \vert 0\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 &0\end{bmatrix}^T,
\]
!et
and finally
!bt
\[
\vert 11\rangle = \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{A}}\otimes \vert 1\rangle_{\mathrm{B}}=\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 &1\end{bmatrix}^T.
\]
!et

These computational basis states define also the eigenstates of the non-interacting  Hamiltonian
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 00 \rangle = \epsilon_{00}\vert 00 \rangle,
\]
!et
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 10 \rangle = \epsilon_{10}\vert 10 \rangle,
\]
!et
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 01 \rangle = \epsilon_{01}\vert 01 \rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
H_0\vert 11 \rangle = \epsilon_{11}\vert 11 \rangle.
\]
!et
The interacting part of the Hamiltonian $H_{\mathrm{I}}$ is given by the tensor product of two $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_z$  matrices, respectively, that is
!bt
\[
H_{\mathrm{I}}=H_x\sigma_x\otimes\sigma_x+H_z\sigma_z\otimes\sigma_z,
\]
!et
where $H_x$ and $H_z$ are interaction strength parameters. Our final Hamiltonian matrix is given by
!bt
\[
\bm{H}=\begin{bmatrix} \epsilon_{00}+H_z & 0 & 0 & H_x \\
                       0  & \epsilon_{10}-H_z & H_x & 0 \\
		       0 & H_x & \epsilon_{01}-H_z & 0 \\
		       H_x & 0 & 0 & \epsilon_{11} +H_z \end{bmatrix}.
\] 
!et

The four eigenstates of the above Hamiltonian matrix can in turn be used to
define density matrices. As an example, the density matrix of the
first eigenstate (lowest energy $E_0$) $\Psi_0$ is

!bt
\[
\rho_0=\left(\alpha_{00}\vert 00 \rangle\langle 00\vert+\alpha_{10}\vert 10 \rangle\langle 10\vert+\alpha_{01}\vert 01 \rangle\langle 01\vert+\alpha_{11}\vert 11 \rangle\langle 11\vert\right),
\]
!et

where the coefficients $\alpha_{ij}$ are the eigenvector coefficients
resulting from the solution of the above eigenvalue problem.
