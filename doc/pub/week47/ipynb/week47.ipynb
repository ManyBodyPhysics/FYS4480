    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The coupled-cluster method is an efficient tool to compute properties of many-body systems\n",
    "with an effort that grows polynomial with system size. While\n",
    "this might still be expensive, it is now possible to compute for example atomic nuclei\n",
    "with mass numbers about $A\\approx 208$ (which corresponds to lead) with this method. Recall that\n",
    "full configuration interaction (FCI)\n",
    "exhibits an exponential cost and is therefore limited to systems with few degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some  recent applications see\n",
