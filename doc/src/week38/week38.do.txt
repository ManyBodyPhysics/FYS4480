===== Particle-hole formalism, reminder from last week  =====


Second quantization is a useful and elegant formalism  for constructing many-body  states and 
quantum mechanical operators. One can express and translate many physical processes
into simple pictures such as Feynman diagrams. Expecation values of many-body states are also easily calculated.

However, although the equations are seemingly easy to set up, from a
practical point of view, that is the solution of Schroedinger's
equation, there is no particular gain.  The many-body equation is
equally hard to solve, irrespective of representation.  The cliche
that there is no free lunch brings us down to earth again.  Note
however that a transformation to a particular basis, for cases where
the interaction obeys specific symmetries, can ease the solution of
Schroedinger's equation.


!split
===== Redefining the reference state =====

But there is at least one important case where second quantization
comes to our rescue.  It is namely easy to introduce another reference
state than the pure vacuum $|0\rangle $, where all single-particle
states are active.  With many particles present it is often useful to
introduce another reference state than the vacuum state$|0\rangle
$. We will label this state $|c\rangle$ ($c$ for core) and as we will
see it can reduce considerably the complexity and thereby the
dimensionality of the many-body problem. It allows us to sum up to
infinite order specific many-body correlations.  The particle-hole
representation is one of these handy representations.




!split
===== New operators =====

In the original particle representation these states are products of the creation operators  $a_{\alpha_i}^\dagger$ acting on the true vacuum $|0\rangle $.
We have 
!bt
\begin{align}
 |\alpha_1\alpha_2\dots\alpha_{n-1}\alpha_n\rangle &=& a_{\alpha_1}^\dagger a_{\alpha_2}^\dagger \dots
					a_{\alpha_{n-1}}^\dagger a_{\alpha_n}^\dagger |0\rangle  label{eq:2-47a} \\
	|\alpha_1\alpha_2\dots\alpha_{n-1}\alpha_n\alpha_{n+1}\rangle &=&
		a_{\alpha_1}^\dagger a_{\alpha_2}^\dagger \dots a_{\alpha_{n-1}}^\dagger a_{\alpha_n}^\dagger
		a_{\alpha_{n+1}}^\dagger |0\rangle  label{eq:2-47b} \\
	|\alpha_1\alpha_2\dots\alpha_{n-1}\rangle &=& a_{\alpha_1}^\dagger a_{\alpha_2}^\dagger \dots
		a_{\alpha_{n-1}}^\dagger |0\rangle  label{eq:2-47c}
\end{align}
!et




!split
===== Reference states =====
If we use Eq.~(ref{eq:2-47a}) as our new reference state, we can simplify considerably the representation of 
this state
!bt
\begin{equation}
	|c\rangle  \equiv |\alpha_1\alpha_2\dots\alpha_{n-1}\alpha_n\rangle =
		a_{\alpha_1}^\dagger a_{\alpha_2}^\dagger \dots a_{\alpha_{n-1}}^\dagger a_{\alpha_n}^\dagger |0\rangle  label{eq:2-48a}
\end{equation}
!et
The new reference states for the $n+1$ and $n-1$ states can then be written as
!bt
\begin{align}
	|\alpha_1\alpha_2\dots\alpha_{n-1}\alpha_n\alpha_{n+1}\rangle &=& (-1)^n a_{\alpha_{n+1}}^\dagger |c\rangle 
		\equiv (-1)^n |\alpha_{n+1}\rangle_c label{eq:2-48b} \\
	|\alpha_1\alpha_2\dots\alpha_{n-1}\rangle &=& (-1)^{n-1} a_{\alpha_n} |c\rangle  
		\equiv (-1)^{n-1} |\alpha_{n-1}\rangle_c label{eq:2-48c} 
\end{align}
!et




!split
===== Hole and particle states =====

The first state has one additional particle with respect to the new vacuum state
$|c\rangle $  and is normally referred to as a one-particle state or one particle added to the 
many-body reference state. 
The second state has one particle less than the reference vacuum state  $|c\rangle $ and is referred to as
a one-hole state. 
When dealing with a new reference state it is often convenient to introduce 
new creation and annihilation operators since we have 
from Eq.~(ref{eq:2-48c})
!bt
\begin{equation}
	a_\alpha |c\rangle  \neq 0 label{eq:2-49}
\end{equation}
!et
since  $\alpha$ is contained  in $|c\rangle $, while for the true vacuum we have 
$a_\alpha |0\rangle  = 0$ for all $\alpha$.


!split
===== Redefinition of creation and annihilation operators =====

The new reference state leads to the definition of new creation and annihilation operators
which satisfy the following relations
!bt
\begin{align}
	b_\alpha |c\rangle  &=& 0 label{eq:2-50a} \\
	\{b_\alpha^\dagger , b_\beta^\dagger \} = \{b_\alpha , b_\beta \} &=& 0 \nonumber  \\
	\{b_\alpha^\dagger , b_\beta \} &=& \delta_{\alpha \beta} label{eq:2-50c}
\end{align}
!et
We assume also that the new reference state is properly normalized
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\langle c | c \rangle = 1 label{eq:2-51}
\end{equation}
!et




!split
===== Physical interpretation =====

The physical interpretation of these new operators is that of so-called quasiparticle states.
This means that a state defined by the addition of one extra particle to a reference state $|c\rangle $ may not necesseraly be interpreted as one particle coupled to a core.
We define now new creation operators that act on a state $\alpha$ creating a new quasiparticle state
!bt
\begin{equation}
	b_\alpha^\dagger|c\rangle  = \Bigg\{ \begin{array}{ll}
		a_\alpha^\dagger |c\rangle  = |\alpha\rangle, & \alpha > F \\
		\\
		a_\alpha |c\rangle  = |\alpha^{-1}\rangle, & \alpha \leq F
	\end{array} label{eq:2-52}
\end{equation}
!et
where $F$ is the Fermi level representing the last  occupied single-particle orbit 
of the new reference state $|c\rangle $. 

!split
===== Annihilation operator =====
The annihilation is the hermitian conjugate of the creation operator
!bt
\[
	b_\alpha = (b_\alpha^\dagger)^\dagger,
\]
!et
resulting in
!bt
\begin{equation}
	b_\alpha^\dagger = \Bigg\{ \begin{array}{ll}
		a_\alpha^\dagger & \alpha > F \\
		\\
		a_\alpha & \alpha \leq F
	\end{array} \qquad 
	b_\alpha = \Bigg\{ \begin{array}{ll}
		a_\alpha & \alpha > F \\
		\\
		 a_\alpha^\dagger & \alpha \leq F
	\end{array} label{eq:2-54}
\end{equation}
!et


!split
===== Introducing the concept of quasiparticle states =====

With the new creation and annihilation operator  we can now construct 
many-body quasiparticle states, with one-particle-one-hole states, two-particle-two-hole
states etc in the same fashion as we previously constructed many-particle states. 
We can write a general particle-hole state as
!bt
\begin{equation}
	|\beta_1\beta_2\dots \beta_{n_p} \gamma_1^{-1} \gamma_2^{-1} \dots \gamma_{n_h}^{-1}\rangle \equiv
		\underbrace{b_{\beta_1}^\dagger b_{\beta_2}^\dagger \dots b_{\beta_{n_p}}^\dagger}_{>F}
		\underbrace{b_{\gamma_1}^\dagger b_{\gamma_2}^\dagger \dots b_{\gamma_{n_h}}^\dagger}_{\leq F} |c\rangle label{eq:2-56}
\end{equation}
!et
We can now rewrite our one-body and two-body operators in terms of the new creation and annihilation operators.

!split
===== Number operator =====

The number operator becomes
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\hat{N} = \sum_\alpha a_\alpha^\dagger a_\alpha= 
\sum_{\alpha > F} b_\alpha^\dagger b_\alpha + n_c - \sum_{\alpha \leq F} b_\alpha^\dagger b_\alpha label{eq:2-57b}
\end{equation}
!et
where $n_c$ is the number of particle in the new vacuum state $|c\rangle $.  
The action of $\hat{N}$ on a many-body state results in 
!bt
\begin{equation}
	N |\beta_1\beta_2\dots \beta_{n_p} \gamma_1^{-1} \gamma_2^{-1} \dots \gamma_{n_h}^{-1}\rangle = (n_p + n_c - n_h) |\beta_1\beta_2\dots \beta_{n_p} \gamma_1^{-1} \gamma_2^{-1} \dots \gamma_{n_h}^{-1}\rangle label{2-59}
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== More manipulations =====
Here  $n=n_p +n_c - n_h$ is the total number of particles in the quasi-particle state of 
Eq.~(ref{eq:2-56}). Note that  $\hat{N}$ counts the total number of particles  present 
!bt
\begin{equation}
	N_{qp} = \sum_\alpha b_\alpha^\dagger b_\alpha, label{eq:2-60}
\end{equation}
!et
gives us the number of quasi-particles as can be seen by computing
!bt
\begin{equation}
	N_{qp}= |\beta_1\beta_2\dots \beta_{n_p} \gamma_1^{-1} \gamma_2^{-1} \dots \gamma_{n_h}^{-1}\rangle
		= (n_p + n_h)|\beta_1\beta_2\dots \beta_{n_p} \gamma_1^{-1} \gamma_2^{-1} \dots \gamma_{n_h}^{-1}\rangle label{eq:2-61}
\end{equation}
!et
where $n_{qp} = n_p + n_h$ is the total number of quasi-particles.


!split
===== Onebody operator =====

We express the one-body operator $\hat{H}_0$ in terms of the quasi-particle creation and annihilation operators, resulting in
!bt
\begin{align}
	\hat{H}_0 &=& \sum_{\alpha\beta > F} \langle \alpha|\hat{h}_0|\beta\rangle  b_\alpha^\dagger b_\beta +
		\sum_{\alpha > F, \beta \leq F } \left[\langle \alpha|\hat{h}_0|\beta\rangle b_\alpha^\dagger b_\beta^\dagger + \langle \beta|\hat{h}_0|\alpha\rangle b_\beta  b_\alpha \right] \nonumber \\
	&+& \sum_{\alpha \leq F} \langle \alpha|\hat{h}_0|\alpha\rangle - \sum_{\alpha\beta \leq F} \langle \beta|\hat{h}_0|\alpha\rangle b_\alpha^\dagger b_\beta label{eq:2-63b}
\end{align}
!et
The first term  gives contribution only for particle states, while the last one
contributes only for holestates. The second term can create or destroy a set of
quasi-particles and 
the third term is the contribution  from the vacuum state $|c\rangle$.



!split
===== New notations =====

Before we continue with the expressions for the two-body operator, we introduce a nomenclature we will use for the rest of this
text. It is inspired by the notation used in quantum chemistry.
We reserve the labels $i,j,k,\dots$ for hole states and $a,b,c,\dots$ for states above $F$, viz.~particle states.
This means also that we will skip the constraint $\leq F$ or $> F$ in the summation symbols. 
Our operator $\hat{H}_0$  reads now 
!bt
\begin{align}
	\hat{H}_0 &=& \sum_{ab} \langle a|\hat{h}|b\rangle b_a^\dagger b_b +
		\sum_{ai} \left[
		\langle a|\hat{h}|i\rangle b_a^\dagger b_i^\dagger + 
		\langle i|\hat{h}|a\rangle b_i  b_a \right] \nonumber \\
	&+& \sum_{i} \langle i|\hat{h}|i\rangle - 
		\sum_{ij} \langle j|\hat{h}|i\rangle
		b_i^\dagger b_j label{eq:2-63c}
\end{align} 
!et



!split
===== Two-particle operator =====

The two-particle operator in the particle-hole formalism  is more complicated since we have
to translate four indices $\alpha\beta\gamma\delta$ to the possible combinations of particle and hole
states.  When performing the commutator algebra we can regroup the operator in five different terms
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H}_I = \hat{H}_I^{(a)} + \hat{H}_I^{(b)} + \hat{H}_I^{(c)} + \hat{H}_I^{(d)} + \hat{H}_I^{(e)} label{eq:2-65}
\end{equation}
!et
Using anti-symmetrized  matrix elements, 
bthe term  $\hat{H}_I^{(a)}$ is  
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H}_I^{(a)} = \frac{1}{4}
	\sum_{abcd} \langle ab|\hat{V}|cd\rangle 
		b_a^\dagger b_b^\dagger b_d b_c label{eq:2-66}
\end{equation}
!et


!split
===== More rewriting =====
The next term $\hat{H}_I^{(b)}$  reads
!bt
\begin{equation}
	 \hat{H}_I^{(b)} = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{abci}\left(\langle ab|\hat{V}|ci\rangle b_a^\dagger b_b^\dagger b_i^\dagger b_c +\langle ai|\hat{V}|cb\rangle b_a^\dagger b_i b_b b_c\right) label{eq:2-67b}
\end{equation}
!et
This term conserves the number of quasiparticles but creates or removes a 
three-particle-one-hole  state. 
For $\hat{H}_I^{(c)}$  we have
!bt
\begin{align}
	\hat{H}_I^{(c)}& =& \frac{1}{4}
		\sum_{abij}\left(\langle ab|\hat{V}|ij\rangle b_a^\dagger b_b^\dagger b_j^\dagger b_i^\dagger +
		\langle ij|\hat{V}|ab\rangle b_a  b_b b_j b_i \right)+  \nonumber \\
	&&	\frac{1}{2}\sum_{abij}\langle ai|\hat{V}|bj\rangle b_a^\dagger b_j^\dagger b_b b_i + 
		\frac{1}{2}\sum_{abi}\langle ai|\hat{V}|bi\rangle b_a^\dagger b_b. label{eq:2-68c}
\end{align}
!et



!split
===== More terms =====
The first line stands for the creation of a two-particle-two-hole state, while the second line represents
the creation to two one-particle-one-hole pairs
while the last term represents a contribution to the particle single-particle energy
from the hole states, that is an interaction between the particle states and the hole states
within the new vacuum  state.

The fourth term reads
!bt
\begin{align}
	 \hat{H}_I^{(d)}& = &\frac{1}{4} 
	 	\sum_{aijk}\left(\langle ai|\hat{V}|jk\rangle b_a^\dagger b_k^\dagger b_j^\dagger b_i+
\langle ji|\hat{V}|ak\rangle b_k^\dagger b_j b_i b_a\right)+\nonumber \\
&&\frac{1}{4}\sum_{aij}\left(\langle ai|\hat{V}|ji\rangle b_a^\dagger b_j^\dagger+
\langle ji|\hat{V}|ai\rangle - \langle ji|\hat{V}|ia\rangle b_j b_a \right). label{eq:2-69d} 
\end{align}
!et

!split
===== Last expressions =====
The terms in the first line  stand for the creation of a particle-hole state 
interacting with hole states, we will label this as a two-hole-one-particle contribution. 
The remaining terms are a particle-hole state interacting with the holes in the vacuum state. 
Finally we have 
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H}_I^{(e)} = \frac{1}{4}
		 \sum_{ijkl}
		 \langle kl|\hat{V}|ij\rangle b_i^\dagger b_j^\dagger b_l b_k+
	        \frac{1}{2}\sum_{ijk}\langle ij|\hat{V}|kj\rangle b_k^\dagger b_i
	        +\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}\langle ij|\hat{V}|ij\rangle label{eq:2-70d}
\end{equation}
!et
The first terms represents the 
interaction between two holes while the second stands for the interaction between a hole and the remaining holes in the vacuum state.
It represents a contribution to single-hole energy  to first order.
The last term collects all contributions to the energy of the ground state of a closed-shell system arising
from hole-hole correlations.

=====  Summarizing and defining a normal-ordered Hamiltonian, part I =====

!bt
\[
  \Phi_{AS}(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_N; x_1, \dots x_N)=
            \frac{1}{\sqrt{A}} \sum_{\hat{P}} (-1)^P \hat{P} \prod_{i=1}^A \psi_{\alpha_i}(x_i),
\]
!et
which is equivalent with $|\alpha_1 \dots \alpha_N\rangle= a_{\alpha_1}^{\dagger} \dots a_{\alpha_N}^{\dagger} |0\rangle$. We have also
!bt
    \[
        a_p^\dagger|0\rangle = |p\rangle, \quad a_p |q\rangle = \delta_{pq}|0\rangle
    \]

with         $i,j,\ldots \leq \alpha_F, \quad a,b,\ldots > \alpha_F, \quad p,q, \ldots - \textrm{any}$
!bt
\[
        a_i|\Phi_0\rangle = |\Phi_i\rangle, \hspace{0.5cm} a_a^\dagger|\Phi_0\rangle = |\Phi^a\rangle
\]
!et

=====  Summarizing and defining a normal-ordered Hamiltonian, part III =====

The one-body operator is defined as
!bt
\[
 \hat{F} = \sum_{pq} \langle p|\hat{f}|q\rangle a_p^\dagger a_q
\]
!et
while the two-body opreator is defined as
!bt
\[
\hat{V} = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{pqrs} \langle pq|\hat{v}|rs\rangle_{AS} a_p^\dagger a_q^\dagger a_s a_r
\]
!et
where we have defined the antisymmetric matrix elements
!bt
\[
\langle pq|\hat{v}|rs\rangle_{AS} = \langle pq|\hat{v}|rs\rangle - \langle pq|\hat{v}|sr\rangle.
\]
!et

!split
=====  Summarizing and defining a normal-ordered Hamiltonian, part III =====

We can also define a three-body operator
!bt
\[
\hat{V}_3 = \frac{1}{36} \sum_{pqrstu} \langle pqr|\hat{v}_3|stu\rangle_{AS}

\]
!et
with the antisymmetrized matrix element
!bt
\begin{align}
            \langle pqr|\hat{v}_3|stu\rangle_{AS} = \langle pqr|\hat{v}_3|stu\rangle + \langle pqr|\hat{v}_3|tus\rangle + \langle pqr|\hat{v}_3|ust\rangle- \langle pqr|\hat{v}_3|sut\rangle - \langle pqr|\hat{v}_3|tsu\rangle - \langle pqr|\hat{v}_3|uts\rangle.
\end{align}

!split
===== The Jordan-Wigner transformation, additional material and digression linking with quantum computing =====

For a spin-$1/2$ one-dimensional quantum spin-chain a fermionization
procedure exists 
which allows the mapping between spin operators and fermionic
creation-annihilation operators.
The algebra governing the spin chain is the $SU(2)$ algebra, represented by
the $\sigma$-matrices. The Jordan-Wigner transformation is a
transformation from fermionic annihilation and creation operators to
the $\sigma$-matrices of a spin-$1/2$ chain.

!split
===== Isomorphism =====

There is an isomorphism 
between the two systems, meaning that any $a$ or $a^\dag$ operator can be
transformed into a tensor product of $\sigma$-matrices operating on a
set of qubits.  
The authors demonstrated, with an emphasis on single-particle fermionic operators,  
that the Jordan-Wigner transformation
ensures efficient, i.e., not exponential complexity, simulations of a
fermionic system on a quantum computer. 
Similar transformations must be found for other systems, in order to
efficiently simulate many-body systems. 

We present here the various ingredients needed in order to transform a given 
Hamiltonian into a practical form suitable  for quantum mechanical simulations. 


!split
===== Creation and annihilation operators =====
We begin with the  fermionic creation and annihilation operators, which satisfy the following
anticommutation relations
!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:anticommutationrelations}
\{a_k, a_l\}=\{a_k^\dag, a_l^\dag\}= 0, \quad 
\{a_k^\dag, a_l\} = \delta_{kl}.
\end{equation}
!et
Thereafter we define the three traceless and Hermitian generators of the $SU(2)$ group, the
$\sigma$-matrices $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$ and $\sigma_z$.  Together 
with the
identity matrix ${\bf 1}$ they form a complete basis for all Hermitian $2\times2$
matrices. They can be used to write all Hamiltonians on a spin $1/2$
chain when taking sums of tensor products of these, in other words  
they form a product basis for the operators on the qubits.


!split
===== Pauli matrices =====
The three $\sigma$-matrices are
!bt
\begin{equation}
\sigma_x = \begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 1\\
  1 & 0 
\end{pmatrix},
\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix}
  0 & -i\\
  i & 0 
\end{pmatrix}, \quad
\sigma_z = \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & 0\\
  0 & -1 
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== Raising and lowewring matrices =====
We define the raising and lowering matrices as
!bt
\[
\sigma_+ = \frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x + i\sigma_y)=
\begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 1\\
  0 & 0 
\end{pmatrix},
\]
!et
!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:raisingAndLowerin}
\sigma_- = \frac{1}{2}(\sigma_x - i\sigma_y)
=\begin{pmatrix}
  0 & 0\\
  1 & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== Transformation of operators =====
The transformation is based on the fact that for each possible
quantum state of the fermion system, there can be either one or zero
fermions. Therefore we need $n$ qubits for a system with $n$ possible
fermion states. A qubit in state $ |0\rangle ^i=a^\dag_i|vacuum\rangle$ 
represents a state with a
fermion, while $ |1\rangle ^i=|vacuum\rangle$ represents no fermions. Then the raising
operator $\sigma_+$ changes $ |1\rangle $ into $ |0\rangle $ when
!bt
\begin{equation}
 |0\rangle  \equiv \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad
 |1\rangle  \equiv \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}  
!et

!split
===== Creation operators in terms of Pauli matrices =====

This means that $\sigma_+$ acts as a creation operator, and $\sigma_-$
acts as an annihilation operator. In addition, because of the
anticommutation of creation(annihilation)  operators for different states we have 
$a_1^\dag a_2^\dag |vacuum\rangle = - a_2^\dag a_1^\dag |vacuum\rangle$, meaning that for creation and
annihilation operators for states higher than the state corresponding
to the first qubit, we need to multiply with a $\sigma_z$-matrix on
all the qubits leading up to the one in question, in order  to get the correct
sign in the final operation. This leads us to the Jordan-Wigner
transformation 
!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:JWtransformation}
a^\dag_n = \left(\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \sigma_z^k\right) \sigma_+^n, \quad 
a_n = \left(\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \sigma_z^k\right) \sigma_-^n.
\end{equation}
!et
The notation $\sigma_z^i\sigma_+^j$ means a tensor product of the
identity matrix on all qubits other than $i$ and $j$, ${\bf 1}\otimes
\sigma_z \otimes {\bf 1} \otimes \sigma_+\otimes{\bf 1}$, if $i<j$, with ${\bf 1}$
being the  identity matrices of appropriate dimension.



!split
===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====

We have defined the ansatz for the ground state as 
!bt
\[
|\Phi_0\rangle = \left(\prod_{i\le F}\hat{a}_{i}^{\dagger}\right)|0\rangle,
\]
!et
where the index $i$ defines different single-particle states up to the Fermi level. We have assumed that we have $N$ fermions. 

!split
===== One-particle-one-hole state =====

A given one-particle-one-hole ($1p1h$) state can be written as
!bt
\[
|\Phi_i^a\rangle = \hat{a}_{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_i|\Phi_0\rangle,
\]
!et
while a $2p2h$ state can be written as
!bt
\[
|\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle = \hat{a}_{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_{b}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_j\hat{a}_i|\Phi_0\rangle,
\]
!et
and a general $NpNh$ state as 
!bt
\[
|\Phi_{ijk\dots}^{abc\dots}\rangle = \hat{a}_{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_{b}^{\dagger}\hat{a}_{c}^{\dagger}\dots\hat{a}_k\hat{a}_j\hat{a}_i|\Phi_0\rangle.
\]
!et


!split
===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====

We can then expand our exact state function for the ground state 
as

===== Intermediate normalization =====
Since the normalization of $\Psi_0$ is at our disposal and since $C_0$ is by hypothesis non-zero, we may arbitrarily set $C_0=1$ with 
corresponding proportional changes in all other coefficients. Using this so-called intermediate normalization we have
!bt
\[
\langle \Psi_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle = \langle \Phi_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle = 1,

resulting in

===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====

We rewrite

in a more compact form as 
!bt
\[
|\Psi_0\rangle=\sum_{PH}C_H^P\Phi_H^P=\left(\sum_{PH}C_H^P\hat{A}_H^P\right)|\Phi_0\rangle,
\]
!et
where $H$ stands for $0,1,\dots,n$ hole states and $P$ for $0,1,\dots,n$ particle states.

!split
===== Compact expression of correlated part =====

We have introduced the operator $\hat{A}_H^P$ which contains an equal number of creation and annihilation operators.

Our requirement of unit normalization gives
!bt
\[
\langle \Psi_0 | \Phi_0 \rangle = \sum_{PH}|C_H^P|^2= 1,
\]
!et
and the energy can be written as 
!bt
\[
E= \langle \Psi_0 | \hat{H} |\Psi_0 \rangle= \sum_{PP'HH'}C_H^{*P}\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle C_{H'}^{P'}.

!et
is solved by diagonalization setting up the Hamiltonian matrix defined by the basis of all possible Slater determinants. A diagonalization
# to do: add text about Rayleigh-Ritz
is equivalent to finding the variational minimum   of 
!bt
\[
 \langle \Psi_0 | \hat{H} |\Psi_0 \rangle-\lambda \langle \Psi_0 |\Psi_0 \rangle,
\]
!et
where $\lambda$ is a variational multiplier to be identified with the energy of the system.

!split
===== Minimization =====

The minimization process results in 
!bt
\[
\delta\left[ \langle \Psi_0 | \hat{H} |\Psi_0 \rangle-\lambda \langle \Psi_0 |\Psi_0 \rangle\right]=0,
\]
!et
and since the coefficients $\delta[C_H^{*P}]$ and $\delta[C_{H'}^{P'}]$ are complex conjugates it is necessary and sufficient to require the quantities that multiply with $\delta[C_H^{*P}]$ to vanish.  Varying the latter coefficients we have then
!bt
\[
\sum_{P'H'}\left\{\delta[C_H^{*P}]\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle C_{H'}^{P'}-
\lambda( \delta[C_H^{*P}]C_{H'}^{P'}]\right\} = 0.
\]
!et




!split
===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====
This leads to 
!bt
\[
\sum_{P'H'}\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle C_{H'}^{P'}-\lambda C_H^{P}=0,
\]
!et
for all sets of $P$ and $H$.

If we then multiply by the corresponding $C_H^{*P}$ and sum over $PH$ we obtain
!bt
\[ 
\sum_{PP'HH'}C_H^{*P}\langle \Phi_H^P | \hat{H} |\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle C_{H'}^{P'}-\lambda\sum_{PH}|C_H^P|^2=0,
\]
!et
leading to the identification $\lambda = E$.


!split
===== Full Configuration Interaction Theory =====

An alternative way to derive the last equation is to start from 
!bt
\[
(\hat{H} -E)|\Psi_0\rangle = (\hat{H} -E)\sum_{P'H'}C_{H'}^{P'}|\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle=0, 
\]
!et
and if this equation is successively projected against all $\Phi_H^P$ in the expansion of $\Psi$, then the last equation on the previous slide
results.   As stated previously, one solves this equation normally by diagonalization. If we are able to solve this equation exactly (that is
numerically exactly) in a large Hilbert space (it will be truncated in terms of the number of single-particle states included in the definition
of Slater determinants), it can then serve as a benchmark for other many-body methods which approximate the correlation operator
$\hat{C}$.  




!split
=====  FCI and the exponential growth =====

Full configuration interaction theory calculations provide in principle, if we can diagonalize numerically, all states of interest. The dimensionality of the problem explodes however quickly.

The total number of Slater determinants which can be built with say $N$ neutrons distributed among $n$ single particle states is
!bt
\[
\left (\begin{array}{c} n \\ N\end{array} \right) =\frac{n!}{(n-N)!N!}. 
\]
!et


For a model space which comprises the first for major shells only $0s$, $0p$, $1s0d$ and $1p0f$ we have $40$ single particle states for neutrons and protons.  For the eight neutrons of oxygen-16 we would then have
!bt
\[
\left (\begin{array}{c} 40 \\ 8\end{array} \right) =\frac{40!}{(32)!8!}\sim 10^{9}, 
\]
!et
and multiplying this with the number of proton Slater determinants we end up with approximately with a dimensionality $d$ of $d\sim 10^{18}$.



!split
=====  Exponential wall =====
!bblock
This number can be reduced if we look at specific symmetries only. However, the dimensionality explodes quickly!

* For Hamiltonian matrices of dimensionalities  which are smaller than $d\sim 10^5$, we would use so-called direct methods for diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix
* For larger dimensionalities iterative eigenvalue solvers like Lanczos' method are used. The most efficient codes at present can handle matrices of $d\sim 10^{10}$.

where the energy $E_0$ is the reference energy and $\Delta E$ defines the so-called correlation energy.

In our discussions  of the  Hartree-Fock method planned for week 39, 
we are going to compute the elements $\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{i}^{a}\rangle $ and $\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle$.  If we are using a Hartree-Fock basis, then these quantities result in
$\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{i}^{a}\rangle=0$ and we are left with a *correlation energy* given by
!bt
\[
E-E_0 =\Delta E^{HF}=\sum_{abij}\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle C_{ij}^{ab}.

This equation determines the correlation energy but not the coefficients $C$. 
!eblock

=====  Rewriting the FCI equation, does not stop here  =====

We need more equations. Our next step is to set up

\sum_{bcdjkl}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{jkl}^{bcd} \rangle C_{jkl}^{bcd}=0.
\]

===== Finding the coefficients =====
This equation will allow us to find an expression for the coefficents $C_i^a$ since we can rewrite this equation as 
!bt
\[
\langle i | \hat{f}| a\rangle +\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{i}^{a} \rangle C_{i}^{a}+ \sum_{bj\ne ai}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{j}^{b} \rangle C_{j}^{b}+
\sum_{bcjk}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{jk}^{bc} \rangle C_{jk}^{bc}+
\sum_{bcdjkl}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{jkl}^{bcd} \rangle C_{jkl}^{bcd}=EC_i^a.

=====  Rewriting the FCI equation  =====

We see that on the right-hand side we have the energy $E$. This leads to a non-linear equation in the unknown coefficients. 
These equations are normally solved iteratively ( that is we can start with a guess for the coefficients $C_i^a$). A common choice is to use perturbation theory for the first guess, setting thereby

 C_{i}^{a}=\frac{\langle i | \hat{f}| a\rangle}{\epsilon_i-\epsilon_a}.

The observant reader will however see that we need an equation for $C_{jk}^{bc}$ and $C_{jkl}^{bcd}$ as well.
To find equations for these coefficients we need then to continue our multiplications from the left with the various
$\Phi_{H}^P$ terms. 


For $C_{jk}^{bc}$ we need then
!bt
\[
\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab} | \hat{H} -E| \Phi_0\rangle + \sum_{kc}\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab} | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{k}^{c} \rangle C_{k}^{c}+

A standard choice for the first iteration is to set

!et
At the end we can rewrite our solution of the Schroedinger equation in terms of $n$ coupled equations for the coefficients $C_H^P$.
This is a very cumbersome way of solving the equation. However, by using this iterative scheme we can illustrate how we can compute the
various terms in the wave operator or correlation operator $\hat{C}$. We will later identify the calculation of the various terms $C_H^P$
as parts of different many-body approximations to full CI. In particular, we can  relate this non-linear scheme with Coupled Cluster theory and
many-body perturbation theory.

===== Summarizing FCI and bringing in approximative methods =====

If we can diagonalize large matrices, FCI is the method of choice since:
* It gives all eigenvalues, ground state and excited states
* The eigenvectors are obtained directly from the coefficients $C_H^P$ which result from the diagonalization
* We can compute easily expectation values of other operators, as well as transition probabilities
* Correlations are easy to understand in terms of contributions to a given operator beyond the Hartree-Fock contribution.
