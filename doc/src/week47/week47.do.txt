===== Introduction =====

The coupled-cluster method is an efficient tool to compute properties of many-body systems
with an effort that grows polynomial with system size. While
this might still be expensive, it is now possible to compute for example atomic nuclei
with mass numbers about $A\approx 208$ (which corresponds to lead) with this method. Recall that
full configuration interaction (FCI)
exhibits an exponential cost and is therefore limited to systems with few degrees of freedom.

!split
===== The normal-ordered Hamiltonian =====

We start from the reference state

!bt
\begin{equation}
\vert\Phi_0\rangle = \prod_{i=1}^N a^\dagger_i \vert 0\rangle 
\end{equation}
!et

for the description of a system  with $N$ particles.  Usually, this
reference is the Hartree-Fock state, but that is not necessary as discussed throughout this course.


!split
===== Notations again =====

After we introduced the particle-hole formalism, we have opted for a convention
where the indices $i,j,k,\ldots$ run over hole states,
i.e. orbitals occupied in the reference state, while
$a,b,c,\ldots$ run over particle states, i.e. unoccupied
orbitals. Indices $p,q,r,s$ can identify any orbital.  Let $n_u$ be
the number of unoccupied states, and $N$ is of course the number of
particles, which is also the number of occupied states used to define the ansatz for the ground state. 


!split
===== Hamiltonian =====

We consider the Hamiltonian
!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{Ham} H =
\sum_{pq} \langle p\vert h_0\vert q \rangle a^\dagger_p a_q +
\frac{1}{4}\sum_{pqrs}\langle pq\vert v\vert rs\rangle
a^\dagger_pa^\dagger_q a_sa_r
\end{equation}
!et


!split
===== The reference state =====

The reference state is a non-trivial vacuum of our theory. 
We normal order this Hamiltonian with respect to the nontrivial vacuum
state given by the Hartree-Fock reference and obtain the
normal-ordered Hamiltonian

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{HN}
H_N = \sum_{pq} \langle p\vert f\vert q \rangle \left\{a^\dagger_p a_q\right\} + \frac{1}{4}\sum_{pqrs}\langle pq\vert V\vert rs\rangle \left\{a^\dagger_pa^\dagger_q a_sa_r\right\}.
\end{equation}
!et


!split
===== Hartree-Fock basis =====

Here,
!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{Fock}
\langle p\vert f\vert q \rangle = \langle p\vert h_0\vert q \rangle + \sum_i \langle pi\vert V\vert qi\rangle
\end{equation}
!et

is the Fock matrix. We note that the Fock matrix is diagonal in the
Hartree-Fock basis. The brackets $\{\cdots\}$ denote
normal ordering, i.e. all operators that annihilate the nontrivial
vaccum are to the right of those operators that create
with respect to that vaccum. Normal ordering implies that $\langle
\Phi_0\vert H_N\vert \Phi_0\rangle = 0$.





!split
===== What does ``good'' mean? =====

The coupled-cluster method is a very efficient tool to compute properties of many-particle systems
when a ``good'' reference state is available. Let us assume that the
reference state results from a Hartree-Fock calculation.


How do you know whether a Hartree-Fock state is a ``good'' reference?
Which results of the Hartree-Fock computation will inform you?


!split
===== Answer =====


Once the Hartree-Fock equations are solved, the Fock matrix
becomes diagonal, and its diagonal elements can be viewed
as single-particle energies. Hopefully, there is a clear gap in the
single-particle spectrum at the Fermi surface, i.e. after $N$ orbitals
are filled.




!split
===== To nuclear physics aficionadoss: How many nuclei are accessible with the coupled cluster method based on spherical mean fields? =====

If symmetry-restricted Hartree-Fock is used, one is limited to compute
systems  with closed subshells for neutrons and for protons. On a first
view, this might seem as a severe limitation. But is it? 


If one limits oneself to nuclei with mass number up to
mass number $A=60$, how many nuclei can potentially be described with
the coupled-cluster method? Which of these nuclei are potentially
interesting? Why?

!split
===== Answer =====


Nuclear shell closures are at $N,Z=2,8,20,28,50,82,126$, and subshell
closures at $N,Z=2,6,8,14,16,20,28,32,34,40,50,\ldots$. 

In the physics of nuclei, the evolution of nuclear structure as
neutrons are added (or removed) from an isotope is a key
#interest. Examples are the rare isotopes of helium ($^{8,10}$ He)
#oxygen ($^{22,24,28}$ O), calcium ($^{52,54,60}$ Ca), nickel ($^{78}$
#Ni) and tin ($^{100,132}$ Sn). The coupled-cluster method has the
interest. Examples are the rare isotopes of helium (He-8,10)
oxygen (O-22,24,28), calcium (Ca-52,54,60), nickel (Ni-78) and tin
(Sn-100,132). The coupled-cluster method has the
potential to address questions regarding these nuclei, and in a
several cases was used to make predictions before experimental data
was available. In addition, the method can be used to compute
neighbors of nuclei with closed subshells.


!split
===== An FCI reminder to link with coupled-cluster theory and MBPT =====

We had
!bt
\[
(\hat{H} -E)|\Psi_0\rangle = (\hat{H} -E)\sum_{P'H'}C_{H'}^{P'}|\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle=0. 
\]
!et


As stated previously, one solves this equation normally by
diagonalization. If we are able to solve this equation exactly (that
is numerically exactly) in a large Hilbert space (it will be truncated
in terms of the number of single-particle states included in the
definition of Slater determinants), it can then serve as a benchmark
for other many-body methods which approximate the correlation operator
$\hat{C}$.


!split
===== Rewriting the equations =====
For reasons to come (link with Coupled-Cluster theory and Many-Body perturbation theory), 
we will rewrite the full FCI equation as a set of coupled non-linear equations in terms of the unknown coefficients $C_H^P$. 

To see this, we look at $ \langle \Phi_H^P | = \langle \Phi_0 |$, that is we multiply with $\langle \Phi_0 |$
from the left in
!bt
\[
(\hat{H} -E)\sum_{P'H'}C_{H'}^{P'}|\Phi_{H'}^{P'} \rangle=0, 
\]
!et
and we assume that we have a two-body operator at most.  Using the Condon-Slater rules gives then and equation for the 
correlation energy in terms of $C_i^a$ and $C_{ij}^{ab}$.  We get then
!bt
\[
\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H} -E| \Phi_0\rangle + \sum_{ai}\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{i}^{a} \rangle C_{i}^{a}+
\sum_{abij}\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle C_{ij}^{ab}=0,
\]
!et
or
!bt
\[
E-E_0 =\Delta E=\sum_{ai}\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{i}^{a} \rangle C_{i}^{a}+
\sum_{abij}\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle C_{ij}^{ab},
\]
!et
where the $E_0$ is the reference energy and $\Delta E$ becomes the correlation energy.
We have already computed the expectation values $\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{i}^{a} $ and $\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle$.


!split
===== Slight rewrite =====

We can rewrite
!bt
\[
E-E_0 =\Delta E=\sum_{ai}\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{i}^{a} \rangle C_{i}^{a}+
\sum_{abij}\langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_{ij}^{ab} \rangle C_{ij}^{ab},
\]
!et
as
!bt
\[
\Delta E=\sum_{ai}\langle i| \hat{f}|a \rangle C_{i}^{a}+
\sum_{abij}\langle ij | \hat{v}| ab \rangle C_{ij}^{ab}.
\]
!et


!split
===== Equations for the coeffficients =====

This equation determines the correlation energy but not the coefficients $C$. 
We need more equations. Our next step is to mulitply from the left with $\Phi_i^a$
!bt
\[
\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H} -E| \Phi_0\rangle + \sum_{bj}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{j}^{b} \rangle C_{j}^{b}+
\sum_{bcjk}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{jk}^{bc} \rangle C_{jk}^{bc}+
\sum_{bcdjkl}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{jkl}^{bcd} \rangle C_{jkl}^{bcd}=0,
\]
!et
as this equation will allow us to find an expression for the coefficents $C_i^a$ since we can rewrite this equation as 

!bt
\[
\langle i | \hat{f}| a\rangle +\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}-E|\Phi_{i}^{a} \rangle C_{i}^{a}+ \sum_{bj\ne ai}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{j}^{b} \rangle C_{j}^{b}+
\sum_{bcjk}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{jk}^{bc} \rangle C_{jk}^{bc}+
\sum_{bcdjkl}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{jkl}^{bcd} \rangle C_{jkl}^{bcd}=0.
\]
!et

!split
===== Iterative solutions =====

We rewrite this equation as
!bt
\[
C_{i}^{a}=-(\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}-E|\Phi_{i}^{a})^{-1}\left(\langle i | \hat{f}| a\rangle+ \sum_{bj\ne ai}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{j}^{b} \rangle C_{j}^{b}+\sum_{bcjk}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{jk}^{bc} \rangle C_{jk}^{bc}+
\sum_{bcdjkl}\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}|\Phi_{jkl}^{bcd} \rangle C_{jkl}^{bcd}\right).
\]
!et


!split
===== Coefficients for single excitations  =====

Since these equations are solved iteratively ( that is we can start with a guess for the coefficients $C_i^a$), it is common to start the  iteration 
by setting
!bt
\[
 C_{i}^{a}=-\frac{\langle i | \hat{f}| a\rangle}{\langle \Phi_i^a | \hat{H}-E|\Phi_{i}^{a}\rangle},
\]
!et
and the denominator can be written as
!bt
\[
  C_{i}^{a}=\frac{\langle i | \hat{f}| a\rangle}{\langle i | \hat{f}| i\rangle-\langle a | \hat{f}| a\rangle+\langle ai | \hat{v}| ai\rangle-E}.
\]
!et
The observant reader will however see that we need an equation for $C_{jk}^{bc}$ and $C_{jkl}^{bcd}$ as well.
To find equations for these coefficients we need then to continue our multiplications from the left with the various
$\Phi_{H}^P$ terms. 


!split
===== Double excitations =====

For $C_{jk}^{bc}$ we need then
!bt
\[
\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab} | \hat{H} -E| \Phi_0\rangle + \sum_{kc}\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab} | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{k}^{c} \rangle C_{k}^{c}+
\sum_{cdkl}\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab} | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{kl}^{cd} \rangle C_{kl}^{cd}+
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\sum_{cdeklm}\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab} | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{klm}^{cde} \rangle C_{klm}^{cde}+\sum_{cdefklmn}\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab} | \hat{H} -E|\Phi_{klmn}^{cdef} \rangle C_{klmn}^{cdef}=0,
\]
!et
and we can isolate the coefficients $C_{kl}^{cd}$ in a similar way as we did for the coefficients $C_{i}^{a}$. 

!split
===== $n$-coupled excitations =====

At the end we can rewrite our solution of the Schr\"odinger equation in terms of $n$ coupled equations for the coefficients $C_H^P$.
This is a very cumbersome way of solving the equation. However, by using this iterative scheme we can illustrate how we can compute the
various terms in the wave operator or correlation operator $\hat{C}$. We will later identify the calculation of the various terms $C_H^P$
as parts of different many-body approximations to full CI. In particular, we will relate this non-linear scheme with Coupled Cluster theory and
many-body perturbation theory.

If we use a Hartree-Fock basis, how can one   simplify the equation
!bt
\[
\Delta E=\sum_{ai}\langle i| \hat{f}|a \rangle C_{i}^{a}+
\sum_{abij}\langle ij | \hat{v}| ab \rangle C_{ij}^{ab}?
\]
!et



!split
===== The similarity transformed Hamiltonian =====


There are several ways to view and understand the coupled-cluster
method. A first simple view of coupled-cluster theory is that the
method induces correlations into the reference state by expressing a
correlated state as

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{psi}
\vert\Psi\rangle = e^T \vert\Phi_0\rangle ,
\end{equation}
!et



!split
===== Clusters of excited states =====

Here, $T$ is an operator that induces correlations. We can now demand
that the correlate state (ref{psi}) becomes and eigenstate of the
Hamiltonian $H_N$, i.e.  $H\vert \Psi\rangle = E\vert \Psi\rangle$. This view,
while correct, is not the most productive one.  Instead, we
left-multiply the Schroedinger equation with $e^{-T}$ and find

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{Schroedinger}
\overline{H_N}\vert \Phi_0\rangle = \Delta E \vert \Phi_0\rangle . 
\end{equation}
!et

Here, $\Delta E$ is the correlation energy, and the total energy is
$E=\Delta E+E_{0}^{\mathrm{ref}}$.


!split
===== Similarity transformation =====

The similarity-transformed Hamiltonian is defined as

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{Hsim}
\overline{H_N} \equiv e^{-T} H_N e^T .
\end{equation}
!et


A more productive view on coupled-cluster theory thus emerges: This
method seeks a similarity transformation such that the uncorrelated
reference state becomes an exact eigenstate of the
similarity-transformed Hamiltonian (ref{Hsim}).

!split
===== What $T$ leads to Hermitian $\overline{H_N}$ ? =====

What are the conditions on $T$ such that $\overline{H_N}$ is Hermitian?

!split
===== Answer =====


For a Hermitian $\overline{H_N}$, we need a unitary $e^T$, i.e. an
anti-Hermitian $T$ with $T = -T^\dagger$




As we will see below, coupld-cluster theory employs a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.

!split
===== Understanding (non-unitary) similarity transformations =====

Show that $\overline{H_N}$ has the same eigenvalues as $H_N$ for
arbitrary $T$. What is the spectral decomposition of a non-Hermitian
$\overline{H_N}$ ?

!split
===== Answer =====

Let $H_N\vert E\rangle = E\vert E\rangle$. Thus

!bt
\begin{align*}
H_N e^{T} e^{-T} \vert E\rangle &= E\vert E\rangle , \\
\left(e^{-T} H_N e^T\right) e^{-T} \vert E\rangle &= Ee^{-T} \vert E\rangle , \\
\overline{H_N} e^{-T} \vert E\rangle &= E e^{-T}\vert E\rangle .
\end{align*}
!et

Thus, if $\vert E\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $H_N$ with eigenvalue $E$,
then $e^{-T}\vert E\rangle$ is eigenstate of $\overline{H_N}$ with the same
eigenvalue.

!split
===== Non-hermitian operator =====

A non-Hermitian $\overline{H_N}$ has eigenvalues $E_\alpha$
corresponding to left $\langle L_\alpha\vert $ and right $\vert R_\alpha
\rangle$ eigenstates. Thus

!bt
\begin{align}
\overline{H_N} = \sum_\alpha \vert R_\alpha\rangle E_\alpha \langle L_\alpha \vert 
\end{align}
!et
with bi-orthonormal $\langle L_\alpha\vert R_\beta\rangle = \delta_\alpha^\beta$. 




!split
===== More formalism =====

To make progress, we have to specify the cluster operator $T$. In
coupled cluster theory, this operator is

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{Top}
T \equiv \sum_{ia} t_i^a a^\dagger_a a_i + \frac{1}{4}\sum_{ijab}t_{ij}^{ab}
a^\dagger_aa^\dagger_ba_ja_i + \cdots
+ \frac{1}{(N!)^2}\sum_{i_1\ldots i_N a_1 \ldots a_N}
t_{i_1\ldots i_N}^{a_1\ldots a_N} a^\dagger_{a_1}\cdots a^\dagger_{a_N} a_{i_N}\cdots a_{i_1} .
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== Particle-hole excitations =====

Thus, the operator (ref{Top}) induces particle-hole (p-h)
excitations with respect to the reference. In general, $T$ generates
up to $Ap-Ah$ excitations, and the unknown parameters are the cluster amplitides
$t_i^a$, $t_{ij}^{ab}$, ..., $t_{i_1,\ldots,i_A}^{a_1,\ldots,a_A}$.

!split
===== Full clutser operator =====

Thus, the coupled-cluster method with the full cluster operator
(ref{Top}) is exponentially expensive, just as FCI. To make progress,
we need to make an approximation by truncating the operator. Here, we
will use the CCSD (coupled clusters singles doubles) approximation,
where

!bt
\begin{equation}
\label{Tccsd}
T \equiv \sum_{ia} t_i^a a^\dagger_a a_i + \frac{1}{4}\sum_{ijab}t_{ij}^{ab}
a^\dagger_aa^\dagger_ba_ja_i .
\end{equation}
!et


!split
===== Unknown aplitudes =====
We need to determine the unknown cluster amplitudes that enter in CCSD. Let

!bt
\begin{align}
\vert\Phi_i^a\rangle &= a^\dagger_a a_i \vert \Phi_0\rangle , \\
\vert\Phi_{ij}^{ab}\rangle &= a^\dagger_a a^\dagger_b a_j a_i \vert \Phi_0\rangle
\end{align}
!et

be 1p-1h and 2p-2h excitations of the reference. Computing matrix
elements of the Schroedinger Equation (ref{Schroedinger}) yields

!bt
\begin{align}
\label{ccsd}
\langle \Phi_0\vert \overline{H_N}\vert \Phi_0\rangle &= E_c , \\
\langle \Phi_i^a\vert \overline{H_N}\vert \Phi_0\rangle &= 0 , \\
\langle \Phi_{ij}^{ab}\vert \overline{H_N}\vert \Phi_0\rangle &= 0 .
\end{align}
!et

!split
===== Correlation energy =====

The first equation states that the coupled-cluster correlation energy
is an expectation value of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian. The
second and third equations state that the similarity-transformed
Hamiltonian exhibits no 1p-1h and no 2p-2h excitations. These
equations have to be solved to find the unknown amplitudes $t_i^a$ and
$t_{ij}^{ab}$. Then one can use these amplitudes and compute the
correlation energy from the first line of Eq. (ref{ccsd}).

We note that in the CCSD approximation the reference state is not an
exact eigenstates. Rather, it is decoupled from simple states but
$\overline{H}$ still connects this state to 3p-3h, and 4p-4h states
etc.

!split
===== Good reference state =====

At this point, it is important to recall that we assumed starting from
a ``good'' reference state. In such a case, we might reasonably expect
that the inclusion of 1p-1h and 2p-2h excitations could result in an
accurate approximation. Indeed, empirically one finds that CCSD
accounts for about 90% of the corelation energy, i.e. of the
difference between the exact energy and the Hartree-Fock energy. The
inclusion of triples (3p-3h excitations) typically yields 99% of the
correlation energy.

We see that the coupled-cluster method in its CCSD approximation
yields a similarity-transformed Hamiltonian that is of a two-body
structure with respect to a non-trivial vacuum. When viewed in this
light, the coupled-cluster method ``transforms'' an $A$-body problem
(in CCSD) into a two-body problem, albeit with respect to a nontrivial
vacuum.


!split
===== Exercise: Why is CCD not exact? =====

Above we argued that a similarity transformation preserves all eigenvalues. Nevertheless, the CCD correlation energy is not the exact correlation energy. Explain!




The CCD approximation does not make $\vert\Phi_0\rangle$ an exact
eigenstate of $\overline{H_N}$; it is only an eigenstate when the
similarity-transformed Hamiltonian is truncated to at most 2p-2h
states. The full $\overline{H_N}$, with $T=T_2$, would involve
six-body terms (do you understand this?), and this full Hamiltonian
would reproduce the exact correlation energy. Thus CCD is a similarity
transformation plus a truncation, which decouples the ground state only
from 2p-2h states.



!split
===== Computing the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian =====

The solution of the CCSD equations, i.e. the second and third line of
Eq. (ref{ccsd}), and the computation of the correlation energy
requires us to compute matrix elements of the similarity-transformed
Hamiltonian (ref{Hsim}). This can be done with the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion

!bt
\begin{align}
\overline{H_N} &= e^{-T} H_N e^T \\
&=H_N + \left[ H_N, T\right]+ \frac{1}{2!}\left[ \left[ H_N, T\right], T\right]
+ \frac{1}{3!}\left[\left[ \left[ H_N, T\right], T\right], T\right] +\ldots .
\end{align}
!et


!split
===== The cluster operator =====

We now come to a key element of coupled-cluster theory: the cluster
operator (ref{Top}) consists of sums of terms that consist of particle
creation and hole annihilation operators (but no particle annihilation
or hole creation operators). Thus, all terms that enter $T$ commute
with each other. This means that the commutators in the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion  can only be non-zero
because each $T$ must connect to $H_N$ (but no $T$ with another
$T$). Thus, the expansion is finite.


!split
===== Non-hermitian Hamiltonian =====

We see that the (disadvantage of having a) non-Hermitian Hamiltonian
$\overline{H_N}$ leads to the advantage that the
Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion is finite, thus leading to the
possibility to compute $\overline{H_N}$ exactly.

!split
===== Similarity transformed Hamiltonian =====

We write the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian as

!bt
\begin{align}
\overline{H_N}=\sum_{pq} \overline{H}^p_q a^\dagger_q a_p + {1\over 4} \sum_{pqrs} \overline{H}^{pq}_{rs} a^\dagger_p a^\dagger_q a_s a_r + \ldots
\end{align}
!et
with
!bt
\begin{align}
\overline{H}^p_q &\equiv \langle p\vert \overline{H_N}\vert q\rangle , \\
\overline{H}^{pq}_{rs} &\equiv \langle pq\vert \overline{H_N}\vert rs\rangle .
\end{align}
!et

If we truncate the operator $T$ at the level of singles and doubles,
the CCSD Eqs.~(ref{ccsd}) for the amplitudes can be written as
$\overline{H}_i^a = 0$ and $\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab}=0$.

!split
===== CCD Approximation =====

In what follows, we will consider the coupled cluster doubles (CCD)
approximation. This approximation is valid in cases where the system
cannot exhibit any particle-hole excitations (such as nuclear matter
when formulated on a momentum-space grid) or for the pairing model (as
the pairing interactions only excites pairs of particles). In this
case $t_i^a=0$ for all $i, a$, and $\overline{H}_i^a=0$. The CCD
approximation is also of some sort of leading order approximation in
the Hartree-Fock basis (as the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian exhibits no
particle-hole excitations).


!split
===== Deriving the CCD equations =====

Let us consider the matrix element $\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab}$. Clearly,
it consists of all diagrams (i.e. all combinations of $T_2$, and a
single $F$ or $V$ that have two incoming hole lines and two outgoing
particle lines. Write down all these diagrams.


We start systematically and  consider all combinations of $F$ and $V$ diagrams with 0, 1, and 2 cluster amplitudes $T_2$.

!split
===== The algebraic expression  =====
!bt
\begin{align*}
\overline{H}_{ij}^{ab} &= \langle ab\vert V\vert ij\rangle + P(ab)\sum_c f_c^bt_{ij}^{ac} - P(ij)\sum_k f_j^k t_{ik}^{ab} \\
&+ {1\over 2} \sum_{cd} \langle ab\vert V\vert cd\rangle t_{ij}^{cd}+ {1\over 2} \sum_{kl} \langle kl\vert V\vert ij\rangle t_{kl}^{ab} + P(ab)P(ij)\sum_{kc} \langle kb\vert V\vert cj \rangle t_{ik}^{ac} \\
&+ {1\over 2} P(ij)P(ab)\sum_{kcld} \langle kl\vert V\vert cd\rangle t_{ik}^{ac}t_{lj}^{db} 
+ {1\over 2} P(ij)\sum_{kcld} \langle kl\vert V\vert cd\rangle t_{ik}^{cd}t_{lj}^{ab}\\
&+ {1\over 2} P(ab)\sum_{kcld} \langle kl\vert V\vert cd\rangle t_{kl}^{ac}t_{ij}^{db}
+ {1\over 4} \sum_{kcld} \langle kl\vert V\vert cd\rangle t_{ij}^{cd}t_{kl}^{ab} . 
\end{align*}
!et




!split
===== CCD for the pairing Hamiltonian =====


You learned about the pairing Hamiltonian earlier in the second midterm. Convince yourself that this Hamiltonian does not induce any
1p-1h excitations. Let us solve the CCD equations for this
problem. This consists of the following steps

o Write a function that compute the potential, i.e. it returns a four-indexed array (or tensor). We need $\langle ab\vert V\vert cd\rangle$, $\langle ij\vert V\vert kl\rangle$, and $\langle ab\vert V\vert ij\rangle$. Why is there no $\langle ab\vert V\vert id\rangle$ or $\langle ai\vert V\vert jb\rangle$ ?

o Write a function that computes the Fock matrix, i.e. a two-indexed array. We only need $f_a^b$ and $f_i^j$. Why? 

o Initialize the cluster amplitudes according and solve the equations for the amplitues itereatively.
