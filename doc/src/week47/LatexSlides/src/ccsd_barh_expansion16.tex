    \begin{itemize}
        \item No contractions possible between cluster operators. \pause
        \item Cluster operators need to contract with free indices to the left. \pause
        \item Disconnected parts automatically cancel in the commutator. \pause
        \item Onebody operators can connect to maximum two cluster operators. \pause
        \item Twobody operators can connect to maximum four cluster operators. \pause
        \item Different terms in the $\barh$ expansion contributes to different equations.
