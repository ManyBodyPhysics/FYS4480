    \emph{Contract $\op{H}_N$ with $\op{T}$ in all possible unique combinations that satisfy a given form. The diagram equation is the sum of all these diagrams.}

    \pause
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Contract one $\op{H}_N$ element with $0,1$ or multiple $\op{T}$ elements. \pause
        \item All $\op{T}$ elements must have \alert{atleast} one contraction with $\op{H}_N$. \pause
        \item No contractions between $\op{T}$ elements are allowed. \pause
        \item A single $\op{T}$ element can contract with a single element of $\op{H}_N$ in different ways.
