===== Particle-hole formalism =====


Second quantization is a useful and elegant formalism  for constructing many-body  states and 
quantum mechanical operators. One can express and translate many physical processes
into simple pictures such as Feynman diagrams. Expecation values of many-body states are also easily calculated.

However, although the equations are seemingly easy to set up, from a
practical point of view, that is the solution of Schroedinger's
equation, there is no particular gain.  The many-body equation is
equally hard to solve, irrespective of representation.  The cliche
that there is no free lunch brings us down to earth again.  Note
however that a transformation to a particular basis, for cases where
the interaction obeys specific symmetries, can ease the solution of
Schroedinger's equation.


!split
===== Redefining the reference state =====

But there is at least one important case where second quantization
comes to our rescue.  It is namely easy to introduce another reference
state than the pure vacuum $|0\rangle $, where all single-particle
states are active.  With many particles present it is often useful to
introduce another reference state than the vacuum state$|0\rangle
$. We will label this state $|c\rangle$ ($c$ for core) and as we will
see it can reduce considerably the complexity and thereby the
dimensionality of the many-body problem. It allows us to sum up to
infinite order specific many-body correlations.  The particle-hole
representation is one of these handy representations.




!split
===== New operators =====

In the original particle representation these states are products of the creation operators  $a_{\alpha_i}^\dagger$ acting on the true vacuum $|0\rangle $.
We have 
!bt
\begin{align}
 |\alpha_1\alpha_2\dots\alpha_{n-1}\alpha_n\rangle &=& a_{\alpha_1}^\dagger a_{\alpha_2}^\dagger \dots
					a_{\alpha_{n-1}}^\dagger a_{\alpha_n}^\dagger |0\rangle  label{eq:2-47a} \\
	|\alpha_1\alpha_2\dots\alpha_{n-1}\alpha_n\alpha_{n+1}\rangle &=&
		a_{\alpha_1}^\dagger a_{\alpha_2}^\dagger \dots a_{\alpha_{n-1}}^\dagger a_{\alpha_n}^\dagger
		a_{\alpha_{n+1}}^\dagger |0\rangle  label{eq:2-47b} \\
	|\alpha_1\alpha_2\dots\alpha_{n-1}\rangle &=& a_{\alpha_1}^\dagger a_{\alpha_2}^\dagger \dots
		a_{\alpha_{n-1}}^\dagger |0\rangle  label{eq:2-47c}
\end{align}
!et




!split
===== Reference states =====
If we use Eq.~(ref{eq:2-47a}) as our new reference state, we can simplify considerably the representation of 
this state
!bt
\begin{equation}
	|c\rangle  \equiv |\alpha_1\alpha_2\dots\alpha_{n-1}\alpha_n\rangle =
		a_{\alpha_1}^\dagger a_{\alpha_2}^\dagger \dots a_{\alpha_{n-1}}^\dagger a_{\alpha_n}^\dagger |0\rangle  label{eq:2-48a}
\end{equation}
!et
The new reference states for the $n+1$ and $n-1$ states can then be written as
!bt
\begin{align}
	|\alpha_1\alpha_2\dots\alpha_{n-1}\alpha_n\alpha_{n+1}\rangle &=& (-1)^n a_{\alpha_{n+1}}^\dagger |c\rangle 
		\equiv (-1)^n |\alpha_{n+1}\rangle_c label{eq:2-48b} \\
	|\alpha_1\alpha_2\dots\alpha_{n-1}\rangle &=& (-1)^{n-1} a_{\alpha_n} |c\rangle  
		\equiv (-1)^{n-1} |\alpha_{n-1}\rangle_c label{eq:2-48c} 
\end{align}
!et




!split
===== Hole and particle states =====

The first state has one additional particle with respect to the new vacuum state
$|c\rangle $  and is normally referred to as a one-particle state or one particle added to the 
many-body reference state. 
The second state has one particle less than the reference vacuum state  $|c\rangle $ and is referred to as
a one-hole state. 
When dealing with a new reference state it is often convenient to introduce 
new creation and annihilation operators since we have 
from Eq.~(ref{eq:2-48c})
!bt
\begin{equation}
	a_\alpha |c\rangle  \neq 0 label{eq:2-49}
\end{equation}
!et
since  $\alpha$ is contained  in $|c\rangle $, while for the true vacuum we have 
$a_\alpha |0\rangle  = 0$ for all $\alpha$.


!split
===== Redefinition of creation and annihilation operators =====

The new reference state leads to the definition of new creation and annihilation operators
which satisfy the following relations
!bt
\begin{align}
	b_\alpha |c\rangle  &=& 0 label{eq:2-50a} \\
	\{b_\alpha^\dagger , b_\beta^\dagger \} = \{b_\alpha , b_\beta \} &=& 0 \nonumber  \\
	\{b_\alpha^\dagger , b_\beta \} &=& \delta_{\alpha \beta} label{eq:2-50c}
\end{align}
!et
We assume also that the new reference state is properly normalized
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\langle c | c \rangle = 1 label{eq:2-51}
\end{equation}
!et




!split
===== Physical interpretation =====

The physical interpretation of these new operators is that of so-called quasiparticle states.
This means that a state defined by the addition of one extra particle to a reference state $|c\rangle $ may not necesseraly be interpreted as one particle coupled to a core.
We define now new creation operators that act on a state $\alpha$ creating a new quasiparticle state
!bt
\begin{equation}
	b_\alpha^\dagger|c\rangle  = \Bigg\{ \begin{array}{ll}
		a_\alpha^\dagger |c\rangle  = |\alpha\rangle, & \alpha > F \\
		\\
		a_\alpha |c\rangle  = |\alpha^{-1}\rangle, & \alpha \leq F
	\end{array} label{eq:2-52}
\end{equation}
!et
where $F$ is the Fermi level representing the last  occupied single-particle orbit 
of the new reference state $|c\rangle $. 

!split
===== Annihilation operator =====
The annihilation is the hermitian conjugate of the creation operator
!bt
\[
	b_\alpha = (b_\alpha^\dagger)^\dagger,
\]
!et
resulting in
!bt
\begin{equation}
	b_\alpha^\dagger = \Bigg\{ \begin{array}{ll}
		a_\alpha^\dagger & \alpha > F \\
		\\
		a_\alpha & \alpha \leq F
	\end{array} \qquad 
	b_\alpha = \Bigg\{ \begin{array}{ll}
		a_\alpha & \alpha > F \\
		\\
		 a_\alpha^\dagger & \alpha \leq F
	\end{array} label{eq:2-54}
\end{equation}
!et


!split
===== Introducing the concept of quasiparticle states =====

With the new creation and annihilation operator  we can now construct 
many-body quasiparticle states, with one-particle-one-hole states, two-particle-two-hole
states etc in the same fashion as we previously constructed many-particle states. 
We can write a general particle-hole state as
!bt
\begin{equation}
	|\beta_1\beta_2\dots \beta_{n_p} \gamma_1^{-1} \gamma_2^{-1} \dots \gamma_{n_h}^{-1}\rangle \equiv
		\underbrace{b_{\beta_1}^\dagger b_{\beta_2}^\dagger \dots b_{\beta_{n_p}}^\dagger}_{>F}
		\underbrace{b_{\gamma_1}^\dagger b_{\gamma_2}^\dagger \dots b_{\gamma_{n_h}}^\dagger}_{\leq F} |c\rangle label{eq:2-56}
\end{equation}
!et
We can now rewrite our one-body and two-body operators in terms of the new creation and annihilation operators.

!split
===== Number operator =====

The number operator becomes
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\hat{N} = \sum_\alpha a_\alpha^\dagger a_\alpha= 
\sum_{\alpha > F} b_\alpha^\dagger b_\alpha + n_c - \sum_{\alpha \leq F} b_\alpha^\dagger b_\alpha label{eq:2-57b}
\end{equation}
!et
where $n_c$ is the number of particle in the new vacuum state $|c\rangle $.  
The action of $\hat{N}$ on a many-body state results in 
!bt
\begin{equation}
	N |\beta_1\beta_2\dots \beta_{n_p} \gamma_1^{-1} \gamma_2^{-1} \dots \gamma_{n_h}^{-1}\rangle = (n_p + n_c - n_h) |\beta_1\beta_2\dots \beta_{n_p} \gamma_1^{-1} \gamma_2^{-1} \dots \gamma_{n_h}^{-1}\rangle label{2-59}
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== More manipulations =====
Here  $n=n_p +n_c - n_h$ is the total number of particles in the quasi-particle state of 
Eq.~(ref{eq:2-56}). Note that  $\hat{N}$ counts the total number of particles  present 
!bt
\begin{equation}
	N_{qp} = \sum_\alpha b_\alpha^\dagger b_\alpha, label{eq:2-60}
\end{equation}
!et
gives us the number of quasi-particles as can be seen by computing
!bt
\begin{equation}
	N_{qp}= |\beta_1\beta_2\dots \beta_{n_p} \gamma_1^{-1} \gamma_2^{-1} \dots \gamma_{n_h}^{-1}\rangle
		= (n_p + n_h)|\beta_1\beta_2\dots \beta_{n_p} \gamma_1^{-1} \gamma_2^{-1} \dots \gamma_{n_h}^{-1}\rangle label{eq:2-61}
\end{equation}
!et
where $n_{qp} = n_p + n_h$ is the total number of quasi-particles.


!split
===== Onebody operator =====

We express the one-body operator $\hat{H}_0$ in terms of the quasi-particle creation and annihilation operators, resulting in
!bt
\begin{align}
	\hat{H}_0 &=& \sum_{\alpha\beta > F} \langle \alpha|\hat{h}_0|\beta\rangle  b_\alpha^\dagger b_\beta +
		\sum_{\alpha > F, \beta \leq F } \left[\langle \alpha|\hat{h}_0|\beta\rangle b_\alpha^\dagger b_\beta^\dagger + \langle \beta|\hat{h}_0|\alpha\rangle b_\beta  b_\alpha \right] \nonumber \\
	&+& \sum_{\alpha \leq F} \langle \alpha|\hat{h}_0|\alpha\rangle - \sum_{\alpha\beta \leq F} \langle \beta|\hat{h}_0|\alpha\rangle b_\alpha^\dagger b_\beta label{eq:2-63b}
\end{align}
!et
The first term  gives contribution only for particle states, while the last one
contributes only for holestates. The second term can create or destroy a set of
quasi-particles and 
the third term is the contribution  from the vacuum state $|c\rangle$.



!split
===== New notations =====

Before we continue with the expressions for the two-body operator, we introduce a nomenclature we will use for the rest of this
text. It is inspired by the notation used in quantum chemistry.
We reserve the labels $i,j,k,\dots$ for hole states and $a,b,c,\dots$ for states above $F$, viz.~particle states.
This means also that we will skip the constraint $\leq F$ or $> F$ in the summation symbols. 
Our operator $\hat{H}_0$  reads now 
!bt
\begin{align}
	\hat{H}_0 &=& \sum_{ab} \langle a|\hat{h}|b\rangle b_a^\dagger b_b +
		\sum_{ai} \left[
		\langle a|\hat{h}|i\rangle b_a^\dagger b_i^\dagger + 
		\langle i|\hat{h}|a\rangle b_i  b_a \right] \nonumber \\
	&+& \sum_{i} \langle i|\hat{h}|i\rangle - 
		\sum_{ij} \langle j|\hat{h}|i\rangle
		b_i^\dagger b_j label{eq:2-63c}
\end{align} 
!et



!split
===== Two-particle operator =====

The two-particle operator in the particle-hole formalism  is more complicated since we have
to translate four indices $\alpha\beta\gamma\delta$ to the possible combinations of particle and hole
states.  When performing the commutator algebra we can regroup the operator in five different terms
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H}_I = \hat{H}_I^{(a)} + \hat{H}_I^{(b)} + \hat{H}_I^{(c)} + \hat{H}_I^{(d)} + \hat{H}_I^{(e)} label{eq:2-65}
\end{equation}
!et
Using anti-symmetrized  matrix elements, 
bthe term  $\hat{H}_I^{(a)}$ is  
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H}_I^{(a)} = \frac{1}{4}
	\sum_{abcd} \langle ab|\hat{V}|cd\rangle 
		b_a^\dagger b_b^\dagger b_d b_c label{eq:2-66}
\end{equation}
!et


!split
===== More rewriting =====
The next term $\hat{H}_I^{(b)}$  reads
!bt
\begin{equation}
	 \hat{H}_I^{(b)} = \frac{1}{4} \sum_{abci}\left(\langle ab|\hat{V}|ci\rangle b_a^\dagger b_b^\dagger b_i^\dagger b_c +\langle ai|\hat{V}|cb\rangle b_a^\dagger b_i b_b b_c\right) label{eq:2-67b}
\end{equation}
!et
This term conserves the number of quasiparticles but creates or removes a 
three-particle-one-hole  state. 
For $\hat{H}_I^{(c)}$  we have
!bt
\begin{align}
	\hat{H}_I^{(c)}& =& \frac{1}{4}
		\sum_{abij}\left(\langle ab|\hat{V}|ij\rangle b_a^\dagger b_b^\dagger b_j^\dagger b_i^\dagger +
		\langle ij|\hat{V}|ab\rangle b_a  b_b b_j b_i \right)+  \nonumber \\
	&&	\frac{1}{2}\sum_{abij}\langle ai|\hat{V}|bj\rangle b_a^\dagger b_j^\dagger b_b b_i + 
		\frac{1}{2}\sum_{abi}\langle ai|\hat{V}|bi\rangle b_a^\dagger b_b. label{eq:2-68c}
\end{align}
!et



!split
===== More terms =====
The first line stands for the creation of a two-particle-two-hole state, while the second line represents
the creation to two one-particle-one-hole pairs
while the last term represents a contribution to the particle single-particle energy
from the hole states, that is an interaction between the particle states and the hole states
within the new vacuum  state.

The fourth term reads
!bt
\begin{align}
	 \hat{H}_I^{(d)}& = &\frac{1}{4} 
	 	\sum_{aijk}\left(\langle ai|\hat{V}|jk\rangle b_a^\dagger b_k^\dagger b_j^\dagger b_i+
\langle ji|\hat{V}|ak\rangle b_k^\dagger b_j b_i b_a\right)+\nonumber \\
&&\frac{1}{4}\sum_{aij}\left(\langle ai|\hat{V}|ji\rangle b_a^\dagger b_j^\dagger+
\langle ji|\hat{V}|ai\rangle - \langle ji|\hat{V}|ia\rangle b_j b_a \right). label{eq:2-69d} 
\end{align}
!et

!split
===== Last expressions =====
The terms in the first line  stand for the creation of a particle-hole state 
interacting with hole states, we will label this as a two-hole-one-particle contribution. 
The remaining terms are a particle-hole state interacting with the holes in the vacuum state. 
Finally we have 
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\hat{H}_I^{(e)} = \frac{1}{4}
		 \sum_{ijkl}
		 \langle kl|\hat{V}|ij\rangle b_i^\dagger b_j^\dagger b_l b_k+
	        \frac{1}{2}\sum_{ijk}\langle ij|\hat{V}|kj\rangle b_k^\dagger b_i
	        +\frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij}\langle ij|\hat{V}|ij\rangle label{eq:2-70d}
\end{equation}
!et
The first terms represents the 
interaction between two holes while the second stands for the interaction between a hole and the remaining holes in the vacuum state.
It represents a contribution to single-hole energy  to first order.
The last term collects all contributions to the energy of the ground state of a closed-shell system arising
from hole-hole correlations.

!bt
\[
  \Phi_{AS}(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_N; x_1, \dots x_N)=

!bt
\begin{align}
            \langle pqr|\hat{v}_3|stu\rangle_{AS} = \langle pqr|\hat{v}_3|stu\rangle + \langle pqr|\hat{v}_3|tus\rangle + \langle pqr|\hat{v}_3|ust\rangle- \langle pqr|\hat{v}_3|sut\rangle - \langle pqr|\hat{v}_3|tsu\rangle - \langle pqr|\hat{v}_3|uts\rangle.
