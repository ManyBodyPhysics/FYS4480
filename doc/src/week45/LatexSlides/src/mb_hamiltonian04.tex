    \note{Filename: mb\_hamiltonian04.tex}

    We define the normal ordered operator
    \begin{equation*}
        \left\{a_a a_b \ldots a_c^\dagger a_d^\dagger\right\} = 
            (-1)^P a_c^\dagger a_d^\dagger \ldots a_a a_b
    \end{equation*}
    All creation operators to the left and all annihilation operators to the right times a factor determined by how many operators have been switched. 

    This object has the highly desired property that the expectation value is always zero
    \begin{equation*}
        \bra{\Phi_0} \left\{a_a a_b \ldots a_c^\dagger a_d^\dagger\right\} \ket{\Phi_0} = 0
    \end{equation*}
