===== Diagram rules, topological distinct diagrams =====

Draw all topologically distinct diagrams by linking up particle and
hole lines with various interaction vertices. Two diagrams can be made
topologically equivalent by deformation of fermion lines under the
restriction that the ordering of the vertices is not changed and
particle lines and hole lines remain particle and\ hole lines.

For the explicit evaluation of a diagram: Sum freely over all internal indices and label all lines.

===== Diagram rules: matrix elements =====
Extract matrix elements for the one-body operators (if present) as
$\langle \mathrm{out} |\hat{f}| \mathrm{in}\rangle$ and for the
two-body operator (if \ present) as
$\bra{\mathrm{left\hspace{0.1cm}out,
right\hspace{0.1cm}out}}|\hat{v}|\ket{\mathrm{left\hspace{0.1cm}in,
right\hspace{0.1cm}in}}$.


!split
===== Diagram rules: phase factors  =====
Calculate the phase factor: $(-1)^{\mathrm{holelines} + \mathrm{loops}}$

!split
===== Diagram rules: equivalent pairs =====
Multiply by a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ for each equivalent pair of
lines (particle lines or hole lines) that begin at the same
interaction vertex and end at the same (yet different from the
first) interaction vertex.

!split
===== Diagram rules: energy denominators  =====
For each interval between successive interaction vertices with minimum
one single-particle state above the Fermi level with $n$ hole states
and $m$ particle stat\ es there is a factor !
