===== Definitions and Second quantization =====

We introduce the time-independent  operators
$a_\alpha^{\dagger}$ and $a_\alpha$   which create and annihilate, respectively, a particle 
in the single-particle state 
$\varphi_\alpha$. 
We define the fermion creation operator
$a_\alpha^{\dagger}$ 
!bt
\begin{equation}
	a_\alpha^{\dagger}|0\rangle \equiv  |\alpha\rangle  label{eq:2-1a},
\end{equation}
!et
and
!bt
\begin{equation}
	a_\alpha^{\dagger}|\alpha_1\dots \alpha_n\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}} \equiv  |\alpha\alpha_1\dots \alpha_n\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}} label{eq:2-1b}
\end{equation}
!et



In Eq.~(ref{eq:2-1a}) 
the operator  $a_\alpha^{\dagger}$  acts on the vacuum state 
$|0\rangle$, which does not contain any particles. Alternatively, we could define  a closed-shell nucleus or atom as our new vacuum, but then
we need to introduce the particle-hole  formalism, see the discussion to come. 

In Eq.~(ref{eq:2-1b}) $a_\alpha^{\dagger}$ acts on an antisymmetric $n$-particle state and 
creates an antisymmetric $(n+1)$-particle state, where the one-body state 
$\varphi_\alpha$ is occupied, under the condition that
$\alpha \ne \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots, \alpha_n$. 
It follows that we can express an antisymmetric state as the product of the creation
operators acting on the vacuum state.  
!bt
\begin{equation}
	|\alpha_1\dots \alpha_n\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}} = a_{\alpha_1}^{\dagger} a_{\alpha_2}^{\dagger} \dots a_{\alpha_n}^{\dagger} |0\rangle label{eq:2-2}
\end{equation}
!et



It is easy to derive the commutation and anticommutation rules  for the fermionic creation operators 
$a_\alpha^{\dagger}$. Using the antisymmetry of the states 
(ref{eq:2-2})
!bt
\begin{equation}
	|\alpha_1\dots \alpha_i\dots \alpha_k\dots \alpha_n\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}} = 
		- |\alpha_1\dots \alpha_k\dots \alpha_i\dots \alpha_n\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}} label{eq:2-3a}
\end{equation}
!et
we obtain
!bt
\begin{equation}
	 a_{\alpha_i}^{\dagger}  a_{\alpha_k}^{\dagger} = - a_{\alpha_k}^{\dagger} a_{\alpha_i}^{\dagger} label{eq:2-3b}
\end{equation}
!et


Using the Pauli principle
!bt
\begin{equation}
	|\alpha_1\dots \alpha_i\dots \alpha_i\dots \alpha_n\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}} = 0 label{eq:2-4a}
\end{equation}
!et
it follows that
!bt
\begin{equation}
	a_{\alpha_i}^{\dagger}  a_{\alpha_i}^{\dagger} = 0. label{eq:2-4b}
\end{equation}
!et
If we combine Eqs.~(ref{eq:2-3b}) and (ref{eq:2-4b}), we obtain the well-known anti-commutation rule
!bt
\begin{equation}
	a_{\alpha}^{\dagger}  a_{\beta}^{\dagger} + a_{\beta}^{\dagger}  a_{\alpha}^{\dagger} \equiv 
		\{a_{\alpha}^{\dagger},a_{\beta}^{\dagger}\} = 0 label{eq:2-5}
\end{equation}
!et



The hermitian conjugate  of $a_\alpha^{\dagger}$ is
!bt
\begin{equation}
	a_{\alpha} = ( a_{\alpha}^{\dagger} )^{\dagger} label{eq:2-6}
\end{equation}
!et
If we take the hermitian conjugate of Eq.~(ref{eq:2-5}), we arrive at 
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\{a_{\alpha},a_{\beta}\} = 0 label{eq:2-7}
\end{equation}
!et




What is the physical interpretation of the operator $a_\alpha$ and what is the effect of 
$a_\alpha$ on a given state $|\alpha_1\alpha_2\dots\alpha_n\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}}$? 
Consider the following matrix element
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\langle\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_n|a_\alpha|\alpha_1'\alpha_2' \dots \alpha_m'\rangle label{eq:2-8}
\end{equation}
!et
where both sides are antisymmetric. We  distinguish between two cases. The first (1) is when
$\alpha \in \{\alpha_i\}$. Using the Pauli principle of Eq.~(ref{eq:2-4a}) it follows
!bt
\begin{equation}
		\langle\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_n|a_\alpha = 0 label{eq:2-9a}
\end{equation}
!et
The second (2) case is when $\alpha \notin \{\alpha_i\}$. It follows that an hermitian conjugation
!bt
\begin{equation}
		\langle \alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_n|a_\alpha = \langle\alpha\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_n|  label{eq:2-9b}
\end{equation}
!et



Eq.~(ref{eq:2-9b}) holds for case (1) since the lefthand side is zero due to the Pauli principle. We write
Eq.~(ref{eq:2-8}) as
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\langle\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_n|a_\alpha|\alpha_1'\alpha_2' \dots \alpha_m'\rangle = 
	\langle \alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_n|\alpha\alpha_1'\alpha_2' \dots \alpha_m'\rangle label{eq:2-10}
\end{equation}
!et
Here we must have $m = n+1$ if Eq.~(ref{eq:2-10}) has to be trivially different from zero.



For the last case, the minus and plus signs apply when the sequence 
$\alpha ,\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots, \alpha_n$ and 
$\alpha_1', \alpha_2', \dots, \alpha_{n+1}'$ are related to each other via even and odd permutations.
If we assume that  $\alpha \notin \{\alpha_i\}$ we obtain 
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\langle\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_n|a_\alpha|\alpha_1'\alpha_2' \dots \alpha_{n+1}'\rangle = 0 label{eq:2-12}
\end{equation}
!et
when $\alpha \in \{\alpha_i'\}$. If $\alpha \notin \{\alpha_i'\}$, we obtain
!bt
\begin{equation}
	a_\alpha\underbrace{|\alpha_1'\alpha_2' \dots \alpha_{n+1}'}\rangle_{\neq \alpha} = 0 label{eq:2-13a}
\end{equation}
!et
and in particular
!bt
\begin{equation}
	a_\alpha |0\rangle = 0 label{eq:2-13b}
\end{equation}
!et


If $\{\alpha\alpha_i\} = \{\alpha_i'\}$, performing the right permutations, the sequence
$\alpha ,\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots, \alpha_n$ is identical with the sequence
$\alpha_1', \alpha_2', \dots, \alpha_{n+1}'$. This results in
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\langle\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_n|a_\alpha|\alpha\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n}\rangle = 1 label{eq:2-14}
\end{equation}
!et
and thus
!bt
\begin{equation}
	a_\alpha |\alpha\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n}\rangle = |\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n}\rangle label{eq:2-15}
\end{equation}
!et



The action of the operator 
$a_\alpha$ from the left on a state vector  is to to remove  one particle in the state
$\alpha$. 
If the state vector does not contain the single-particle state $\alpha$, the outcome of the operation is zero.
The operator  $a_\alpha$ is normally called for a destruction or annihilation operator.

The next step is to establish the  commutator algebra of $a_\alpha^{\dagger}$ and
$a_\beta$. 



The action of the anti-commutator 
$\{a_\alpha^{\dagger}$,$a_\alpha\}$ on a given $n$-particle state is
!bt
\begin{align}
	a_\alpha^{\dagger} a_\alpha \underbrace{|\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n}\rangle}_{\neq \alpha} &= 0 \nonumber \\
	a_\alpha a_\alpha^{\dagger} \underbrace{|\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n}\rangle}_{\neq \alpha} &=
	a_\alpha \underbrace{|\alpha \alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n}\rangle}_{\neq \alpha} = 
	\underbrace{|\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n}\rangle}_{\neq \alpha} label{eq:2-16a}
\end{align}
!et
if the single-particle state $\alpha$ is not contained in the state.




 If it is present
we arrive at
!bt
\begin{align}
	a_\alpha^{\dagger} a_\alpha |\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{k}\alpha \alpha_{k+1} \dots \alpha_{n-1}\rangle &=
	a_\alpha^{\dagger} a_\alpha (-1)^k |\alpha \alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n-1}\rangle \nonumber \\
	= (-1)^k |\alpha \alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n-1}\rangle &=
	|\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{k}\alpha \alpha_{k+1} \dots \alpha_{n-1}\rangle \nonumber \\
	a_\alpha a_\alpha^{\dagger}|\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{k}\alpha \alpha_{k+1} \dots \alpha_{n-1}\rangle &= 0 label{eq:2-16b}
\end{align}
!et
From Eqs.~(ref{eq:2-16a}) and  (ref{eq:2-16b}) we arrive at 
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\{a_\alpha^{\dagger} , a_\alpha \} = a_\alpha^{\dagger} a_\alpha + a_\alpha a_\alpha^{\dagger} = 1 label{eq:2-17}
\end{equation}
!et




The action of $\left\{a_\alpha^{\dagger}, a_\beta\right\}$, with 
$\alpha \ne \beta$ on a given state yields three possibilities. 
The first case is a state vector which contains both $\alpha$ and $\beta$, then either 
$\alpha$ or $\beta$ and finally none of them.



The first case results in
!bt
\begin{align}
	a_\alpha^{\dagger} a_\beta |\alpha\beta\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n-2}\rangle = 0 \nonumber \\
	a_\beta a_\alpha^{\dagger} |\alpha\beta\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n-2}\rangle = 0 label{eq:2-18a}
\end{align}
!et
while the second case gives
!bt
\begin{align}
	 a_\alpha^{\dagger} a_\beta |\beta \underbrace{\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n-1}}_{\neq \alpha}\rangle =& 
	 	|\alpha \underbrace{\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n-1}}_{\neq  \alpha}\rangle \nonumber \\
	a_\beta a_\alpha^{\dagger} |\beta \underbrace{\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n-1}}_{\neq \alpha}\rangle =&
		a_\beta |\alpha\beta\underbrace{\beta \alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n-1}}_{\neq \alpha}\rangle \nonumber \\
	=& - |\alpha\underbrace{\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n-1}}_{\neq \alpha}\rangle label{eq:2-18b}
\end{align}
!et




Finally if the state vector does not contain $\alpha$ and $\beta$
!bt
\begin{align}
	a_\alpha^{\dagger} a_\beta |\underbrace{\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n}}_{\neq \alpha,\beta}\rangle &=& 0 \nonumber \\
	a_\beta a_\alpha^{\dagger} |\underbrace{\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n}}_{\neq \alpha,\beta}\rangle &=& 
		a_\beta |\alpha \underbrace{\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n}}_{\neq \alpha,\beta}\rangle = 0 label{eq:2-18c}
\end{align}
!et
For all three cases we have
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\{a_\alpha^{\dagger},a_\beta \} = a_\alpha^{\dagger} a_\beta + a_\beta a_\alpha^{\dagger} = 0, \quad \alpha \neq \beta label{eq:2-19}
\end{equation}
!et




We can summarize  our findings in Eqs.~(ref{eq:2-17}) and (ref{eq:2-19}) as 
!bt
\begin{equation}
	\{a_\alpha^{\dagger},a_\beta \} = \delta_{\alpha\beta} label{eq:2-20}
\end{equation}
!et
with  $\delta_{\alpha\beta}$ is the Kroenecker $\delta$-symbol.

The properties of the creation and annihilation operators can be summarized as (for fermions)
!bt
\[
	a_\alpha^{\dagger}|0\rangle \equiv  |\alpha\rangle,
\]
!et
and
!bt 
\[
	a_\alpha^{\dagger}|\alpha_1\dots \alpha_n\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}} \equiv  |\alpha\alpha_1\dots \alpha_n\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}}. 
\]
!et
from which follows
!bt
\[
        |\alpha_1\dots \alpha_n\rangle_{\mathrm{AS}} = a_{\alpha_1}^{\dagger} a_{\alpha_2}^{\dagger} \dots a_{\alpha_n}^{\dagger} |0\rangle.
\]
!et



The hermitian conjugate has the folowing properties
!bt
\[
        a_{\alpha} = ( a_{\alpha}^{\dagger} )^{\dagger}.
\]
!et
Finally we found 
!bt
\[
	a_\alpha\underbrace{|\alpha_1'\alpha_2' \dots \alpha_{n+1}'}\rangle_{\neq \alpha} = 0, \quad
		\textrm{in particular } a_\alpha |0\rangle = 0,
\]
!et
and
!bt 
\[
 a_\alpha |\alpha\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n}\rangle = |\alpha_1\alpha_2 \dots \alpha_{n}\rangle,
\]
!et
and the corresponding commutator algebra
!bt
\[
	\{a_{\alpha}^{\dagger},a_{\beta}^{\dagger}\} = \{a_{\alpha},a_{\beta}\} = 0 \hspace{0.5cm} 
\{a_\alpha^{\dagger},a_\beta \} = \delta_{\alpha\beta}.
\]
!et


===== Exercise: Expectation values and wave function Ansatzes =====

Consider the fermion Slater determinant as ansatz for a quantum mechanical state function,

!bt
\[
\Phi_{\lambda}^{AS}(x_{1}x_{2}\dots x_{N};\alpha_{1}\alpha_{2}\dots\alpha_{N})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}\sum_{p}(-)^{p}P\prod_{i=1}^{N}\psi_{\alpha_{i}}(x_{i}).
\]
!et

where $P$ is an operator which permutes the coordinates of two
particles. It acts on pairs of particles. We have assumed here that
the number of particles is the same as the number of available
single-particle states, represented by the greek letters
$\alpha_{1}\alpha_{2}\dots\alpha_{N}$.  We assume that the
single-particle basis $\psi_{\alpha_{i}}(x_{i})$ is a so-called
orthonormal basis.

===== Exercise: first many-body example =====

We will now consider a simple three-level problem, depicted in the
figure below. This is our first and very simple model of a possible
many-fermion problem and what we later will call full configuration
interaction theory (dubbed FCI).  We will assume the particles are
fermions.  The single-particle states are labelled by the quantum
number $p$ and can accomodate up to two single particles, viz., every
single-particle state is doubly degenerate (you could think of this as
one state having spin up and the other spin down).  We let the spacing
between the doubly degenerate single-particle states be constant, with
value $d$.  The first state has energy $d$. There are only three
available single-particle states, $p=1$, $p=2$ and $p=3$, as
illustrated in the figure.

!bsubex
How many two-particle Slater determinants can we construct in this space? 
!esubex

!bsubex
We limit ourselves to a system with only the two lowest single-particle orbits and two particles, $p=1$ and $p=2$.
!esubex

!bsubex
We assume that we can write the Hamiltonian as
!bt
\[
       \hat{H}=\hat{H}_0+\hat{H}_I,
\]
!et
and that the onebody part of the Hamiltonian with single-particle operator $\hat{h}_0$ has the property
!bt
\[
\hat{h}_0\psi_{p\sigma} = p\times d \psi_{p\sigma},
\]
!et
where we have added a spin quantum number $\sigma$. 
We assume also that the only two-particle states that can exist are those where two particles are in the 
same state $p$, as shown by the two possibilities to the left in the figure.
The two-particle matrix elements of $\hat{H}_I$ have all a constant value, $-g$.
Show then that the Hamiltonian matrix can be written as 
!bt
\[
\left(\begin{array}{cc}2d-g &-g \\
-g &4d-g \end{array}\right),
\]
!et
and find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  What is the mixing of the state with two particles in $p=2$ 
to the wave function with two-particles in $p=1$? Discuss your results in terms of a linear combination
of Slater determinants.


Add the possibility that the two particles can be in the state with
$p=3$ as well and find the Hamiltonian matrix, the eigenvalues and the
eigenvectors. We still insist that we only have two-particle states
composed of two particles being in the same level $p$. You can
diagonalize numerically your $3\times 3$ matrix.

This
simple model catches several birds with a stone. It demonstrates how
we can build linear combinations of Slater determinants and interpret
these as different admixtures to a given state. It represents also the
way we are going to interpret these contributions.  The two-particle
states above $p=1$ will be interpreted as excitations from the ground
state configuration, $p=1$ here.  The reliability of this ansatz for
the ground state, with two particles in $p=1$, depends on the strength
of the interaction $g$ and the single-particle spacing $d$.  Finally,
this model is a simple schematic ansatz for studies of pairing
correlations and thereby superfluidity/superconductivity in fermionic
systems.
