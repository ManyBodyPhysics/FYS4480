===== Why Hartree-Fock? Derivation of Hartree-Fock equations in coordinate space =====

Hartree-Fock (HF) theory is an algorithm for finding an approximative expression for the ground state of a given Hamiltonian. The basic ingredients are
 *  Define a single-particle basis $\{\psi_{\alpha}\}$ so that
!bt
\[ 
\hat{h}^{\mathrm{HF}}\psi_{\alpha} = \varepsilon_{\alpha}\psi_{\alpha}
\]
!et
with the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian defined as
!bt
\[
\hat{h}^{\mathrm{HF}}=\hat{t}+\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}+\hat{u}^{\mathrm{HF}}
\]
!et
 *  The term  $\hat{u}^{\mathrm{HF}}$ is a single-particle potential to be determined by the HF algorithm.
 *  The HF algorithm means to choose $\hat{u}^{\mathrm{HF}}$ in order to have 
!bt
\[ \langle \hat{H} \rangle = E^{\mathrm{HF}}= \langle \Phi_0 | \hat{H}|\Phi_0 \rangle
\]
!et
that is to find a local minimum with a Slater determinant $\Phi_0$ being the ansatz for the ground state. 
 *  The variational principle ensures that $E^{\mathrm{HF}} \ge E_0$, with $E_0$ the exact ground state energy.

We will show that the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian $\hat{h}^{\mathrm{HF}}$ equals our definition of the operator $\hat{f}$ discussed in connection with the new definition of the normal-ordered Hamiltonian (see later lectures), that is we have, for a specific matrix element
!bt
\[
\langle p |\hat{h}^{\mathrm{HF}}| q \rangle =\langle p |\hat{f}| q \rangle=\langle p|\hat{t}+\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}|q \rangle +\sum_{i\le F} \langle pi | \hat{V} | qi\rangle_{AS},
\]
!et
meaning that
!bt
\[
\langle p|\hat{u}^{\mathrm{HF}}|q\rangle = \sum_{i\le F} \langle pi | \hat{V} | qi\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
The so-called Hartree-Fock potential $\hat{u}^{\mathrm{HF}}$ brings an explicit medium dependence due to the summation over all single-particle states below the Fermi level $F$. It brings also in an explicit dependence on the two-body interaction (in nuclear physics we can also have complicated three- or higher-body forces). The two-body interaction, with its contribution from the other bystanding fermions, creates an effective mean field in which a given fermion moves, in addition to the external potential $\hat{u}_{\mathrm{ext}}$ which confines the motion of the fermion. For systems like nuclei, there is no external confining potential. Nuclei are examples of self-bound systems, where the binding arises due to the intrinsic nature of the strong force. For nuclear systems thus, there would be no external one-body potential in the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian. 

===== Variational Calculus and Lagrangian Multipliers  =====

The calculus of variations involves 
problems where the quantity to be minimized or maximized is an integral. 

In the general case we have an integral of the type
!bt
\[ 
E[\Phi]= \int_a^b f(\Phi(x),\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x},x)dx,
\]
!et
where $E$ is the quantity which is sought minimized or maximized.
The problem is that although $f$ is a function of the variables $\Phi$, $\partial \Phi/\partial x$ and $x$, the exact dependence of
$\Phi$ on $x$ is not known.  This means again that even though the integral has fixed limits $a$ and $b$, the path of integration is
not known. In our case the unknown quantities are the single-particle wave functions and we wish to choose an integration path which makes
the functional $E[\Phi]$ stationary. This means that we want to find minima, or maxima or saddle points. In physics we search normally for minima.
Our task is therefore to find the minimum of $E[\Phi]$ so that its variation $\delta E$ is zero  subject to specific
constraints. In our case the constraints appear as the integral which expresses the orthogonality of the  single-particle wave functions.
The constraints can be treated via the technique of Lagrangian multipliers

Let us specialize to the expectation value of the energy for one particle in three-dimensions.
This expectation value reads
!bt
\[
  E=\int dxdydz \psi^*(x,y,z) \hat{H} \psi(x,y,z),
\]
!et
with the constraint
!bt
\[
 \int dxdydz \psi^*(x,y,z) \psi(x,y,z)=1,
\]
!et
and a Hamiltonian
!bt
\[
\hat{H}=-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2+V(x,y,z).
\]
!et
We will, for the sake of notational convenience,  skip the variables $x,y,z$ below, and write for example $V(x,y,z)=V$.

The integral involving the kinetic energy can be written as, with the function $\psi$ vanishing
strongly for large values of $x,y,z$ (given here by the limits $a$ and $b$), 
!bt
 \[
  \int_a^b dxdydz \psi^* \left(-\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2\right) \psi dxdydz = \psi^*\nabla\psi|_a^b+\int_a^b dxdydz\frac{1}{2}\nabla\psi^*\nabla\psi.
\]
!et
We will drop the limits $a$ and $b$ in the remaining discussion. 
Inserting this expression into the expectation value for the energy and taking the variational minimum  we obtain
!bt
\[
\delta E = \delta \left\{\int dxdydz\left( \frac{1}{2}\nabla\psi^*\nabla\psi+V\psi^*\psi\right)\right\} = 0.
\]
!et

The constraint appears in integral form as 
!bt
\[
 \int dxdydz \psi^* \psi=\mathrm{constant},
\]
!et
and multiplying with a Lagrangian multiplier $\lambda$ and taking the variational minimum we obtain the final variational equation
!bt
\[
\delta \left\{\int dxdydz\left( \frac{1}{2}\nabla\psi^*\nabla\psi+V\psi^*\psi-\lambda\psi^*\psi\right)\right\} = 0.
\]
!et
We introduce the function  $f$
!bt
\[
  f =  \frac{1}{2}\nabla\psi^*\nabla\psi+V\psi^*\psi-\lambda\psi^*\psi=
\frac{1}{2}(\psi^*_x\psi_x+\psi^*_y\psi_y+\psi^*_z\psi_z)+V\psi^*\psi-\lambda\psi^*\psi,
\]
!et
where we have skipped the dependence on $x,y,z$ and introduced the shorthand $\psi_x$, $\psi_y$ and $\psi_z$  for the various derivatives.

For $\psi^*$ the Euler-Lagrange  equations yield
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial \psi^*}- \frac{\partial }{\partial x}\frac{\partial f}{\partial \psi^*_x}-\frac{\partial }{\partial y}\frac{\partial f}{\partial \psi^*_y}-\frac{\partial }{\partial z}\frac{\partial f}{\partial \psi^*_z}=0,
\] 
!et
which results in 
!bt
\[
    -\frac{1}{2}(\psi_{xx}+\psi_{yy}+\psi_{zz})+V\psi=\lambda \psi.
\]
!et
We can then identify the  Lagrangian multiplier as the energy of the system. The last equation is 
nothing but the standard 
Schroedinger equation and the variational  approach discussed here provides 
a powerful method for obtaining approximate solutions of the wave function.



===== Derivation of Hartree-Fock equations in coordinate space =====

Let us denote the ground state energy by $E_0$. According to the
variational principle we have
!bt
\[
  E_0 \le E[\Phi] = \int \Phi^*\hat{H}\Phi d\mathbf{\tau}
\]
!et
where $\Phi$ is a trial function which we assume to be normalized
!bt
\[
  \int \Phi^*\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} = 1,
\]
!et
where we have used the shorthand $d\mathbf{\tau}=dx_1dx_2\dots dx_N$.




In the Hartree-Fock method the trial function is a Slater
determinant which can be rewritten as 
!bt
\[
  \Psi(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N,\alpha,\beta,\dots,\nu) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}\sum_{P} (-)^PP\psi_{\alpha}(x_1)
    \psi_{\beta}(x_2)\dots\psi_{\nu}(x_N)=\sqrt{N!}\hat{A}\Phi_H,
\]
!et
where we have introduced the anti-symmetrization operator $\hat{A}$ defined by the 
summation over all possible permutations *p* of two fermions.
It is defined as
!bt
\[
  \hat{A} = \frac{1}{N!}\sum_{p} (-)^p\hat{P},
\]
!et
with the the Hartree-function given by the simple product of all possible single-particle function
!bt
\[
  \Phi_H(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_N,\alpha,\beta,\dots,\nu) =
  \psi_{\alpha}(x_1)
    \psi_{\beta}(x_2)\dots\psi_{\nu}(x_N).
\]
!et



Our functional is written as
!bt
\[
  E[\Phi] = \sum_{\mu=1}^N \int \psi_{\mu}^*(x_i)\hat{h}_0(x_i)\psi_{\mu}(x_i) dx_i 
  + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\mu=1}^N\sum_{\nu=1}^N
   \left[ \int \psi_{\mu}^*(x_i)\psi_{\nu}^*(x_j)\hat{v}(r_{ij})\psi_{\mu}(x_i)\psi_{\nu}(x_j)dx_idx_j- \int \psi_{\mu}^*(x_i)\psi_{\nu}^*(x_j)
 \hat{v}(r_{ij})\psi_{\nu}(x_i)\psi_{\mu}(x_j)dx_idx_j\right]
\]
!et
The more compact version reads
!bt
\[
  E[\Phi] 
  = \sum_{\mu}^N \langle \mu | \hat{h}_0 | \mu\rangle+ \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\mu\nu}^N\left[\langle \mu\nu |\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle-\langle \nu\mu |\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle\right].
\]
!et



Since the interaction is invariant under the interchange of two particles it means for example that we have
!bt
\[
\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle =  \langle \nu\mu|\hat{v}|\nu\mu\rangle,  
\]
!et
or in the more general case
!bt
\[
\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\sigma\tau\rangle =  \langle \nu\mu|\hat{v}|\tau\sigma\rangle.  
\]
!et


The direct and exchange matrix elements can be  brought together if we define the antisymmetrized matrix element
!bt
\[
\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle_{AS}= \langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle-\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\nu\mu\rangle,
\]
!et
or for a general matrix element  
!bt
\[
\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\sigma\tau\rangle_{AS}= \langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\sigma\tau\rangle-\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\tau\sigma\rangle.
\]
!et
It has the symmetry property
!bt
\[
\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\sigma\tau\rangle_{AS}= -\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\tau\sigma\rangle_{AS}=-\langle \nu\mu|\hat{v}|\sigma\tau\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
The antisymmetric matrix element is also hermitian, implying 
!bt
\[
\langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\sigma\tau\rangle_{AS}= \langle \sigma\tau|\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et




With these notations we rewrite the Hartree-Fock functional as
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \int \Phi^*\hat{H_I}\Phi d\mathbf{\tau} 
  = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{\mu=1}^N\sum_{\nu=1}^N \langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle_{AS}. label{H2Expectation2}
\end{equation}
!et

Adding the contribution from the one-body operator $\hat{H}_0$ to
(ref{H2Expectation2}) we obtain the energy functional 
!bt
\begin{equation}
  E[\Phi] 
  = \sum_{\mu=1}^N \langle \mu | h | \mu \rangle +
  \frac{1}{2}\sum_{{\mu}=1}^N\sum_{{\nu}=1}^N \langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle_{AS}. label{FunctionalEPhi}
\end{equation}
!et 
In our coordinate space derivations below we will spell out the Hartree-Fock equations in terms of their integrals.




If we generalize the Euler-Lagrange equations to more variables 
and introduce $N^2$ Lagrange multipliers which we denote by 
$\epsilon_{\mu\nu}$, we can write the variational equation for the functional of $E$
!bt
\[
  \delta E - \sum_{\mu\nu}^N \epsilon_{\mu\nu} \delta
  \int \psi_{\mu}^* \psi_{\nu} = 0.
\]
!et
For the orthogonal wave functions $\psi_{i}$ this reduces to
!bt
\[
  \delta E - \sum_{\mu=1}^N \epsilon_{\mu} \delta
  \int \psi_{\mu}^* \psi_{\mu} = 0.
\]
!et




Variation with respect to the single-particle wave functions $\psi_{\mu}$ yields then
!bt
\[
  \sum_{\mu=1}^N \int \delta\psi_{\mu}^*\hat{h_0}(x_i)\psi_{\mu}
  dx_i  
  + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{{\mu}=1}^N\sum_{{\nu}=1}^N \left[ \int
  \delta\psi_{\mu}^*\psi_{\nu}^*\hat{v}(r_{ij})\psi_{\mu}\psi_{\nu} dx_idx_j- \int
  \delta\psi_{\mu}^*\psi_{\nu}^*\hat{v}(r_{ij})\psi_{\nu}\psi_{\mu}
  dx_idx_j \right]+ 
\]
!et
!bt
\[
\sum_{\mu=1}^N \int \psi_{\mu}^*\hat{h_0}(x_i)\delta\psi_{\mu}
  dx_i 
  + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{{\mu}=1}^N\sum_{{\nu}=1}^N \left[ \int
  \psi_{\mu}^*\psi_{\nu}^*\hat{v}(r_{ij})\delta\psi_{\mu}\psi_{\nu} dx_idx_j- \int
  \psi_{\mu}^*\psi_{\nu}^*\hat{v}(r_{ij})\psi_{\nu}\delta\psi_{\mu}
  dx_idx_j \right]-  \sum_{{\mu}=1}^N E_{\mu} \int \delta\psi_{\mu}^*
  \psi_{\mu}dx_i
  -  \sum_{{\mu}=1}^N E_{\mu} \int \psi_{\mu}^*
  \delta\psi_{\mu}dx_i = 0.
\]
!et




Although the variations $\delta\psi$ and $\delta\psi^*$ are not
independent, they may in fact be treated as such, so that the 
terms dependent on either $\delta\psi$ and $\delta\psi^*$ individually 
may be set equal to zero. To see this, simply 
replace the arbitrary variation $\delta\psi$ by $i\delta\psi$, so that
$\delta\psi^*$ is replaced by $-i\delta\psi^*$, and combine the two
equations. We thus arrive at the Hartree-Fock equations
!bt
\begin{equation}
\left[ -\frac{1}{2}\nabla_i^2+ \sum_{\nu=1}^N\int \psi_{\nu}^*(x_j)\hat{v}(r_{ij})\psi_{\nu}(x_j)dx_j \right]\psi_{\mu}(x_i) - \left[ \sum_{{\nu}=1}^N \int\psi_{\nu}^*(x_j)\hat{v}(r_{ij})\psi_{\mu}(x_j) dx_j\right] \psi_{\nu}(x_i) = \epsilon_{\mu} \psi_{\mu}(x_i).  label{eq:hartreefockcoordinatespace}
\end{equation}
!et
Notice that the integration $\int dx_j$ implies an
integration over the spatial coordinates $\mathbf{r_j}$ and a summation
over the spin-coordinate of fermion $j$. We note that the factor of $1/2$ in front of the sum involving the two-body interaction, has been removed. This is due to the fact that we need to vary both $\delta\psi_{\mu}^*$ and
$\delta\psi_{\nu}^*$. Using the symmetry properties of the two-body interaction and interchanging $\mu$ and $\nu$
as summation indices, we obtain two identical terms. 




The two first terms in the last equation are the one-body kinetic energy and the
electron-nucleus potential. The third or *direct* term is the averaged electronic repulsion of the other
electrons. As written, the
term includes the *self-interaction* of 
electrons when $\mu=\nu$. The self-interaction is cancelled in the fourth
term, or the *exchange* term. The exchange term results from our
inclusion of the Pauli principle and the assumed determinantal form of
the wave-function. Equation (ref{eq:hartreefockcoordinatespace}), in addition to the kinetic energy and the attraction from the atomic nucleus that confines the motion of a single electron,   represents now the motion of a single-particle modified by the two-body interaction. The additional contribution to the Schroedinger equation due to the two-body interaction, represents a mean field set up by all the other bystanding electrons, the latter given by the sum over all single-particle states occupied by $N$ electrons. 

The Hartree-Fock equation is an example of an integro-differential equation. These equations involve repeated calculations of integrals, in addition to the solution of a set of coupled differential equations. 
The Hartree-Fock equations can also be rewritten in terms of an eigenvalue problem. The solution of an eigenvalue problem represents often a more practical algorithm and the  solution of  coupled  integro-differential equations.
This alternative derivation of the Hartree-Fock equations is given below.




===== Analysis of Hartree-Fock equations in coordinate space =====

  A theoretically convenient form of the
Hartree-Fock equation is to regard the direct and exchange operator
defined through 
!bt
\begin{equation*}
  V_{\mu}^{d}(x_i) = \int \psi_{\mu}^*(x_j) 
 \hat{v}(r_{ij})\psi_{\mu}(x_j) dx_j
\end{equation*}
!et
and
!bt
\begin{equation*}
  V_{\mu}^{ex}(x_i) g(x_i) 
  = \left(\int \psi_{\mu}^*(x_j) 
 \hat{v}(r_{ij})g(x_j) dx_j
  \right)\psi_{\mu}(x_i),
\end{equation*}
!et
respectively. 




The function $g(x_i)$ is an arbitrary function,
and by the substitution $g(x_i) = \psi_{\nu}(x_i)$
we get
!bt
\begin{equation*}
  V_{\mu}^{ex}(x_i) \psi_{\nu}(x_i) 
  = \left(\int \psi_{\mu}^*(x_j) 
 \hat{v}(r_{ij})\psi_{\nu}(x_j)
  dx_j\right)\psi_{\mu}(x_i).
\end{equation*}
!et
We may then rewrite the Hartree-Fock equations as
!bt
\[
  \hat{h}^{HF}(x_i) \psi_{\nu}(x_i) = \epsilon_{\nu}\psi_{\nu}(x_i),
\]
!et
with
!bt
\[
  \hat{h}^{HF}(x_i)= \hat{h}_0(x_i) + \sum_{\mu=1}^NV_{\mu}^{d}(x_i) -
  \sum_{\mu=1}^NV_{\mu}^{ex}(x_i),
\]
!et
and where $\hat{h}_0(i)$ is the one-body part. The latter is normally chosen as a part which yields solutions in closed form. The harmonic oscilltor is a classical problem thereof.
We normally rewrite the last equation as
!bt
\[
  \hat{h}^{HF}(x_i)= \hat{h}_0(x_i) + \hat{u}^{HF}(x_i). 
\]
!et




===== Hartree-Fock by varying the coefficients of a wave function expansion =====

Another possibility is to expand the single-particle functions in a known basis  and vary the coefficients, 
that is, the new single-particle wave function is written as a linear expansion
in terms of a fixed chosen orthogonal basis (for example the well-known harmonic oscillator functions or the hydrogen-like functions etc).
We define our new Hartree-Fock single-particle basis by performing a unitary transformation 
on our previous basis (labelled with greek indices) as
!bt
\begin{equation}
\psi_p^{HF}  = \sum_{\lambda} C_{p\lambda}\phi_{\lambda}. label{eq:newbasis}
\end{equation}
!et
In this case we vary the coefficients $C_{p\lambda}$. If the basis has infinitely many solutions, we need
to truncate the above sum.  We assume that the basis $\phi_{\lambda}$ is orthogonal.




It is normal to choose a single-particle basis defined as the eigenfunctions
of parts of the full Hamiltonian. The typical situation consists of the solutions of the one-body part of the Hamiltonian, that is we have
!bt
\[
\hat{h}_0\phi_{\lambda}=\epsilon_{\lambda}\phi_{\lambda}.
\]
!et 
The single-particle wave functions $\phi_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r})$, defined by the quantum numbers $\lambda$ and $\mathbf{r}$
are defined as the overlap 
!bt
\[
   \phi_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r})  = \langle \mathbf{r} | \lambda \rangle .
\]
!et

In deriving the Hartree-Fock equations, we  will expand the single-particle functions in a known basis  and vary the coefficients, 
that is, the new single-particle wave function is written as a linear expansion
in terms of a fixed chosen orthogonal basis (for example the well-known harmonic oscillator functions or the hydrogen-like functions etc).

We stated that a unitary transformation keeps the orthogonality. To see this consider first a basis of vectors $\mathbf{v}_i$,
!bt
\[
\mathbf{v}_i = \begin{bmatrix} v_{i1} \\ \dots \\ \dots \\v_{in} \end{bmatrix}
\]
!et
We assume that the basis is orthogonal, that is 
!bt
\[
\mathbf{v}_j^T\mathbf{v}_i = \delta_{ij}.
\]
!et
An orthogonal or unitary transformation
!bt
\[
\mathbf{w}_i=\mathbf{U}\mathbf{v}_i,
\]
!et
preserves the dot product and orthogonality since
!bt
\[
\mathbf{w}_j^T\mathbf{w}_i=(\mathbf{U}\mathbf{v}_j)^T\mathbf{U}\mathbf{v}_i=\mathbf{v}_j^T\mathbf{U}^T\mathbf{U}\mathbf{v}_i= \mathbf{v}_j^T\mathbf{v}_i = \delta_{ij}.
\]
!et

This means that if the coefficients $C_{p\lambda}$ belong to a unitary or orthogonal trasformation (using the Dirac bra-ket notation)
!bt
\[
\vert p\rangle  = \sum_{\lambda} C_{p\lambda}\vert\lambda\rangle,
\]
!et
orthogonality is preserved, that is $\langle \alpha \vert \beta\rangle = \delta_{\alpha\beta}$
and $\langle p \vert q\rangle = \delta_{pq}$. 

This propertry is extremely useful when we build up a basis of many-body Stater determinant based states. 

_Note also that although a basis $\vert \alpha\rangle$ contains an infinity of states, for practical calculations we have always to make some truncations._ 





Before we develop the Hartree-Fock equations, there is another very useful property of determinants that we will use both in connection with Hartree-Fock calculations. This applies also to our previous discussion on full configuration interaction theory.  

Consider the following determinant
!bt
\[
\left| \begin{array}{cc} \alpha_1b_{11}+\alpha_2sb_{12}& a_{12}\\
                         \alpha_1b_{21}+\alpha_2b_{22}&a_{22}\end{array} \right|=\alpha_1\left|\begin{array}{cc} b_{11}& a_{12}\\
                         b_{21}&a_{22}\end{array} \right|+\alpha_2\left| \begin{array}{cc} b_{12}& a_{12}\\b_{22}&a_{22}\end{array} \right|
\]
!et







We can generalize this to  an $n\times n$ matrix and have 
!bt
\[
\left| \begin{array}{cccccc} a_{11}& a_{12} & \dots & \sum_{k=1}^n c_k b_{1k} &\dots & a_{1n}\\
a_{21}& a_{22} & \dots & \sum_{k=1}^n c_k b_{2k} &\dots & a_{2n}\\
\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
a_{n1}& a_{n2} & \dots & \sum_{k=1}^n c_k b_{nk} &\dots & a_{nn}\end{array} \right|=
\sum_{k=1}^n c_k\left| \begin{array}{cccccc} a_{11}& a_{12} & \dots &  b_{1k} &\dots & a_{1n}\\
a_{21}& a_{22} & \dots &  b_{2k} &\dots & a_{2n}\\
\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots\\
\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots\\
a_{n1}& a_{n2} & \dots &  b_{nk} &\dots & a_{nn}\end{array} \right| .
\]
!et
This is a property we will use in our Hartree-Fock discussions. 




We can generalize the previous results, now 
with all elements $a_{ij}$  being given as functions of 
linear combinations  of various coefficients $c$ and elements $b_{ij}$,
!bt
\[
\left| \begin{array}{cccccc} \sum_{k=1}^n b_{1k}c_{k1}& \sum_{k=1}^n b_{1k}c_{k2} & \dots & \sum_{k=1}^n b_{1k}c_{kj}  &\dots & \sum_{k=1}^n b_{1k}c_{kn}\\
\sum_{k=1}^n b_{2k}c_{k1}& \sum_{k=1}^n b_{2k}c_{k2} & \dots & \sum_{k=1}^n b_{2k}c_{kj} &\dots & \sum_{k=1}^n b_{2k}c_{kn}\\
\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots \\
\dots & \dots & \dots & \dots & \dots &\dots \\
\sum_{k=1}^n b_{nk}c_{k1}& \sum_{k=1}^n b_{nk}c_{k2} & \dots & \sum_{k=1}^n b_{nk}c_{kj} &\dots & \sum_{k=1}^n b_{nk}c_{kn}\end{array} \right|=det(\mathbf{C})det(\mathbf{B}),
\]
!et
where $det(\mathbf{C})$ and $det(\mathbf{B})$ are the determinants of $n\times n$ matrices
with elements $c_{ij}$ and $b_{ij}$ respectively.  
This is a property we will use in our Hartree-Fock discussions. Convince yourself about the correctness of the above expression by setting $n=2$. 






With our definition of the new basis in terms of an orthogonal basis we have
!bt
\[
\psi_p(x)  = \sum_{\lambda} C_{p\lambda}\phi_{\lambda}(x).
\]
!et
If the coefficients $C_{p\lambda}$ belong to an orthogonal or unitary matrix, the new basis
is also orthogonal. 
Our Slater determinant in the new basis $\psi_p(x)$ is written as
!bt
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{N!}}
\left| \begin{array}{ccccc} \psi_{p}(x_1)& \psi_{p}(x_2)& \dots & \dots & \psi_{p}(x_N)\\
                            \psi_{q}(x_1)&\psi_{q}(x_2)& \dots & \dots & \psi_{q}(x_N)\\

which is nothing but $det(\mathbf{C})det(\Phi)$, with $det(\Phi)$ being the determinant given by the basis functions $\phi_{\lambda}(x)$. 



In our discussions hereafter we will use our definitions of single-particle states above and below the Fermi ($F$) level given by the labels
$ijkl\dots \le F$ for so-called single-hole states and $abcd\dots > F$ for so-called particle states.
For general single-particle states we employ the labels $pqrs\dots$. 




In Eq.~(ref{FunctionalEPhi}), restated here
!bt
\[
  E[\Phi] 
  = \sum_{\mu=1}^N \langle \mu | h | \mu \rangle +
  \frac{1}{2}\sum_{{\mu}=1}^N\sum_{{\nu}=1}^N \langle \mu\nu|\hat{v}|\mu\nu\rangle_{AS},
\]
!et 
we found the expression for the energy functional in terms of the basis function $\phi_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r})$. We then  varied the above energy functional with respect to the basis functions $|\mu \rangle$. 
Now we are interested in defining a new basis defined in terms of
a chosen basis as defined in Eq.~(ref{eq:newbasis}). We can then rewrite the energy functional as
!bt
\begin{equation}
  E[\Phi^{HF}] 
  = \sum_{i=1}^N \langle i | h | i \rangle +
  \frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij=1}^N\langle ij|\hat{v}|ij\rangle_{AS}, label{FunctionalEPhi2}
\end{equation}
!et
where $\Phi^{HF}$ is the new Slater determinant defined by the new basis of Eq.~(ref{eq:newbasis}). 





Using Eq.~(ref{eq:newbasis}) we can rewrite Eq.~(ref{FunctionalEPhi2}) as 
!bt
\begin{equation}
  E[\Psi] 
  = \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\alpha\beta} C^*_{i\alpha}C_{i\beta}\langle \alpha | h | \beta \rangle +
  \frac{1}{2}\sum_{ij=1}^N\sum_{{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}} C^*_{i\alpha}C^*_{j\beta}C_{i\gamma}C_{j\delta}\langle \alpha\beta|\hat{v}|\gamma\delta\rangle_{AS}. label{FunctionalEPhi3}
\end{equation}
!et





We wish now to minimize the above functional. We introduce again a set of Lagrange multipliers, noting that
since $\langle i | j \rangle = \delta_{i,j}$ and $\langle \alpha | \beta \rangle = \delta_{\alpha,\beta}$, 
the coefficients $C_{i\gamma}$ obey the relation
!bt
\[
 \langle i | j \rangle=\delta_{i,j}=\sum_{\alpha\beta} C^*_{i\alpha}C_{i\beta}\langle \alpha | \beta \rangle=
\sum_{\alpha} C^*_{i\alpha}C_{i\alpha},
\]
!et
which allows us to define a functional to be minimized that reads
!bt
\begin{equation}
  F[\Phi^{HF}]=E[\Phi^{HF}] - \sum_{i=1}^N\epsilon_i\sum_{\alpha} C^*_{i\alpha}C_{i\alpha}.
\end{equation}
!et







Minimizing with respect to $C^*_{i\alpha}$, remembering that the equations for $C^*_{i\alpha}$ and $C_{i\alpha}$
can be written as two  independent equations, we obtain
!bt
\[
\frac{d}{dC^*_{i\alpha}}\left[  E[\Phi^{HF}] - \sum_{j}\epsilon_j\sum_{\alpha} C^*_{j\alpha}C_{j\alpha}\right]=0,
\]
!et
which yields for every single-particle state $i$ and index $\alpha$ (recalling that the coefficients $C_{i\alpha}$ are matrix elements of a unitary (or orthogonal for a real symmetric matrix) matrix)
the following Hartree-Fock equations
!bt
\[
\sum_{\beta} C_{i\beta}\langle \alpha | h | \beta \rangle+
\sum_{j=1}^N\sum_{\beta\gamma\delta} C^*_{j\beta}C_{j\delta}C_{i\gamma}\langle \alpha\beta|\hat{v}|\gamma\delta\rangle_{AS}=\epsilon_i^{HF}C_{i\alpha}.
\]
!et





We can rewrite this equation as (changing dummy variables)
!bt
\[
\sum_{\beta} \left\{\langle \alpha | h | \beta \rangle+
\sum_{j}^N\sum_{\gamma\delta} C^*_{j\gamma}C_{j\delta}\langle \alpha\gamma|\hat{v}|\beta\delta\rangle_{AS}\right\}C_{i\beta}=\epsilon_i^{HF}C_{i\alpha}.
\]
!et
Note that the sums over greek indices run over the number of basis set functions (in principle an infinite number).





Defining 
!bt
\[
h_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}=\langle \alpha | h | \beta \rangle+
\sum_{j=1}^N\sum_{\gamma\delta} C^*_{j\gamma}C_{j\delta}\langle \alpha\gamma|\hat{v}|\beta\delta\rangle_{AS},
\]
!et
we can rewrite the new equations as 
!bt
\begin{equation}
\sum_{\beta}h_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}C_{i\beta}=\epsilon_i^{HF}C_{i\alpha}. label{eq:newhf}
\end{equation}
!et
The latter is nothing but a standard eigenvalue problem. Compared with Eq.~(ref{eq:hartreefockcoordinatespace}),
we see that we do not need to compute any integrals in an iterative procedure for solving the equations.
It suffices to tabulate the matrix elements $\langle \alpha | h | \beta \rangle$ and $\langle \alpha\gamma|\hat{v}|\beta\delta\rangle_{AS}$ once and for all. Successive iterations require thus only a look-up in tables over one-body and two-body matrix elements. These details will be discussed below when we solve the Hartree-Fock equations numerical. 



===== Hartree-Fock algorithm =====

Our Hartree-Fock matrix  is thus
!bt
\[
\hat{h}_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}=\langle \alpha | \hat{h}_0 | \beta \rangle+
\sum_{j=1}^N\sum_{\gamma\delta} C^*_{j\gamma}C_{j\delta}\langle \alpha\gamma|\hat{v}|\beta\delta\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
The Hartree-Fock equations are solved in an iterative waym starting with a guess for the coefficients $C_{j\gamma}=\delta_{j,\gamma}$ and solving the equations by diagonalization till the new single-particle energies
$\epsilon_i^{\mathrm{HF}}$ do not change anymore by a prefixed quantity. 




Normally we assume that the single-particle basis $|\beta\rangle$ forms an eigenbasis for the operator
$\hat{h}_0$, meaning that the Hartree-Fock matrix becomes  
!bt
\[
\hat{h}_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}=\epsilon_{\alpha}\delta_{\alpha,\beta}+
\sum_{j=1}^N\sum_{\gamma\delta} C^*_{j\gamma}C_{j\delta}\langle \alpha\gamma|\hat{v}|\beta\delta\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
The Hartree-Fock eigenvalue problem
!bt
\[
\sum_{\beta}\hat{h}_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}C_{i\beta}=\epsilon_i^{\mathrm{HF}}C_{i\alpha},
\]
!et
can be written out in a more compact form as
!bt
\[
\hat{h}^{HF}\hat{C}=\epsilon^{\mathrm{HF}}\hat{C}. 
\]
!et




The Hartree-Fock equations are, in their simplest form, solved in an iterative way, starting with a guess for the
coefficients $C_{i\alpha}$. We label the coefficients as $C_{i\alpha}^{(n)}$, where the subscript $n$ stands for iteration $n$.
To set up the algorithm we can proceed as follows:

 * We start with a guess $C_{i\alpha}^{(0)}=\delta_{i,\alpha}$. Alternatively, we could have used random starting values as long as the vectors are normalized. Another possibility is to give states below the Fermi level a larger weight.
 * The Hartree-Fock matrix simplifies then to (assuming that the coefficients $C_{i\alpha} $  are real)
!bt
\[
\hat{h}_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}=\epsilon_{\alpha}\delta_{\alpha,\beta}+
\sum_{j = 1}^N\sum_{\gamma\delta} C_{j\gamma}^{(0)}C_{j\delta}^{(0)}\langle \alpha\gamma|\hat{v}|\beta\delta\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et




Solving the Hartree-Fock eigenvalue problem yields then new eigenvectors $C_{i\alpha}^{(1)}$ and eigenvalues
$\epsilon_i^{HF(1)}$. 
 * With the new eigenvalues we can set up a new Hartree-Fock potential 
!bt
\[
\sum_{j = 1}^N\sum_{\gamma\delta} C_{j\gamma}^{(1)}C_{j\delta}^{(1)}\langle \alpha\gamma|\hat{v}|\beta\delta\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
The diagonalization with the new Hartree-Fock potential yields new eigenvectors and eigenvalues.
This process is continued till for example
!bt
\[
\frac{\sum_{p} |\epsilon_i^{(n)}-\epsilon_i^{(n-1)}|}{m} \le \lambda,  
\]
!et
where $\lambda$ is a user prefixed quantity ($\lambda \sim 10^{-8}$ or smaller) and $p$ runs over all calculated single-particle
energies and $m$ is the number of single-particle states.
