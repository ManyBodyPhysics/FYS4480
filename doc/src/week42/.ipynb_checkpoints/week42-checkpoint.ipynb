    "## Discussion: Consequences of HK Theorems\n",
    "\n",
    "DFT exists in principle: HK1 establishes that the ground-state density is as fundamental as the wavefunction – it encapsulates all the information needed to determine the system’s Hamiltonian and thus all ground-state observables. This is a remarkable reduction: instead of a complicated wavefunction $\\Psi$, we can work with $n(\\mathbf{r})$.\n",
    "Energy as a functional of density: HK2 guarantees an energy functional $E[n]$ exists. However, the theorems themselves do not provide an explicit form for $F[n] = T[n] + V_{\\rm int}[n]$. They are existence theorems. The challenge of DFT (and much of this course) is how to approximate $F[n]$ in practice, especially the many-body terms hidden in it.\n",
    "Variational principle: Given HK2, one can variationally obtain the ground state: if we had the exact $E[n]$ functional, minimizing $E[n]$ with respect to $n(\\mathbf{r})$ (subject to $\\int n(\\mathbf{r}) d^3r = N$) yields the true ground-state density and energy. In formal terms, $\\delta {E[n] - \\mu(\\int n - N)} / \\delta n(\\mathbf{r}) = 0$ leads to a condition $\\frac{\\delta E[n]}{\\delta n(\\mathbf{r})}\\big|_{n=n_0} = \\mu$ (constant Fermi level $\\mu$ for the ground state).\n",
    "Proof sketch of HK Theorem I: It’s instructive to see why two different potentials cannot give the same density. Suppose $V_{\\rm ext}^{(1)}(\\mathbf{r})$ and $V_{\\rm ext}^{(2)}(\\mathbf{r})$ yield the same ground-state density $n(\\mathbf{r})$ but different ground-state wavefunctions $\\Psi^{(1)}$ and $\\Psi^{(2)}$. Let $E^{(1)}$ and $E^{(2)}$ be their ground-state energies. Without loss of generality, assume $E^{(1)} < E^{(2)}$. Then, using $\\Psi^{(2)}$ in Hamiltonian 1: $E^{(1)} < \\langle \\Psi^{(2)}|\\hat{H}^{(1)}|\\Psi^{(2)}\\rangle = \\langle \\Psi^{(2)}|\\hat{H}^{(2)}|\\Psi^{(2)}\\rangle + \\int [V_{\\rm ext}^{(1)}(\\mathbf{r})-V_{\\rm ext}^{(2)}(\\mathbf{r})],n(\\mathbf{r}),d^3r = E^{(2)} + \\int [V_{\\rm ext}^{(1)}-V_{\\rm ext}^{(2)}] n(\\mathbf{r})$ . Similarly, exchanging 1↔2 leads to $E^{(2)} < E^{(1)} + \\int [V_{\\rm ext}^{(2)}-V_{\\rm ext}^{(1)}] n(\\mathbf{r})$ . Adding these two inequalities yields $E^{(1)} + E^{(2)} < E^{(1)} + E^{(2)}$, a contradiction. Thus $V_{\\rm ext}^{(1)}$ and $V_{\\rm ext}^{(2)}$ cannot produce the same $n(\\mathbf{r})$. This proves the uniqueness (HK1).\n",
    "Domain and $v$-representability: Not every arbitrary $n(\\mathbf{r})$ is a valid ground-state density of some physical $V_{\\rm ext}$ (this is the issue of $v$-representability). HK theorems assume $n(\\mathbf{r})$ comes from some ground state of a Hamiltonian. Modern proofs (Levy–Lieb constrained search) circumvent some $v$-representability issues by considering minimization over all wavefunctions yielding a density $n$.\n",
    "Implications: The ground-state energy can be obtained in principle by minimizing $E[n]$. However, without an expression for $F[n]$, one cannot perform this minimization in practice. Enter the Kohn–Sham approach (see below), which provides a clever way to approximate $F[n]$ using orbitals."

    "Before rigorous DFT, the Thomas–Fermi (TF) model (1927) was an early density-based theory. It modeled the kinetic energy of electrons in a homogeneous way:\n",
    "T_{\\rm TF}[n] = \\frac{3}{10}(3\\pi^2)^{2/3} \\int n^{5/3}(\\mathbf{r})\\,d^3r\\,,\n",
    "and the electron–electron interaction via a Hartree term $E_{\\rm H}[n] = \\frac{e^2}{2}\\int d^3r,d^3r’ ,\\frac{n(\\mathbf{r}),n(\\mathbf{r}’)}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}’|}$. The total TF energy functional:\n",
    "E_{\\rm TF}[n] = T_{\\rm TF}[n] + E_{\\rm H}[n] + \\int V_{\\rm ext} n(\\mathbf{r})\\,d^3r\\,.\n",
    "Minimizing $E_{\\rm TF}[n]$ for atoms gives a rough electron density profile. However, TF theory neglects shell structure and chemical bonding entirely (no exchange or true fermionic kinetic energy oscillations).\n",
    "Significance: TF theory does not produce bound molecules (it predicts atoms just barely unbound) , indicating that the simplistic functional misses important physics (exchange and quantum oscillations). Nonetheless, it was a foundation that showed the promise of using $n(\\mathbf{r})$ and inspired the development of DFT.\n",
    "Modern DFT vs. TF: The Kohn–Sham method can be viewed as incorporating the missing quantum effects by using an effective single-particle approach (coming next). In effect, Kohn–Sham splits $F[n]$ into a large known part (non-interacting kinetic energy + Hartree) and a smaller unknown remainder (exchange-correlation) that can be approximated.\n",
    "Preview of next lecture: How can we find the correct density without knowing the exact $F[n]$? The answer is the Kohn–Sham scheme, which introduces a fictitious non-interacting system that reproduces the same density. This yields tractable equations for orbitals, which, when solved self-consistently, give the ground-state density and energy."

    "Self-consistent field (SCF): The KS equations $(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 + V_{\\rm eff}n)\\psi_i = \\epsilon_i\\psi_i$ look like independent-particle Schrödinger equations. However, $V_{\\rm eff}(r)$ depends on $n(r)$, which in turn depends on all ${\\psi_i}$. Solving them requires a self-consistent cycle: guess a density (or orbitals) $\\rightarrow$ compute $V_{\\rm eff}$ $\\rightarrow$ solve for new $\\psi_i$ $\\rightarrow$ update $n(r)$ $\\rightarrow$ repeat until convergence. (We will detail this algorithm in Lecture 4.)\n",
    "Exchange–correlation potential: $V_{\\rm xc}(r) = \\delta E_{\\rm xc}/\\delta n(r)$ plays a central role. It includes all many-body effects such as exchange (Pauli exclusion) and electron correlation. In practice, $E_{\\rm xc}[n]$ must be approximated. But if $E_{\\rm xc}$ were known exactly, $V_{\\rm xc}(r)$ ensures that the KS orbitals yield the correct $n(r)$ and energy.\n",
    "Total energy expression: Once the KS equations are solved for the orbitals and eigenvalues, one can compute the total energy as\n",
    "E[n] = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\epsilon_i \\;-\\; \\frac{1}{2}\\int d^3r\\, V_{\\rm H}(r)\\,n(r)\\;+\\; E_{\\rm xc}[n] \\;-\\; \\int d^3r\\, n(r)\\,V_{\\rm xc}(r)\\,.\n",
    "This formula corrects for the fact that $\\sum_i \\epsilon_i$ counts the Hartree energy and $E_{\\rm xc}$ contributions in a non-double-counting way . It can be derived from the variation result and ensures adding $V_{\\rm xc}$ term did not overcount those energies.\n",
    "Physical meaning of $\\epsilon_i$: The KS eigenvalues $\\epsilon_i$ do not strictly equal the true excitation energies of the system (except in special cases). They are Lagrange multipliers to enforce orbital orthonormality. However, the highest occupied KS eigenvalue $\\epsilon_{\\rm HOMO}$ (for exact XC) equals the negative of the ionization energy by Janak’s theorem and the Koopmans’ theorem analogue in DFT. Also, differences $\\epsilon_{i}-\\epsilon_{j}$ often resemble quantum excitation energies (and in practice KS band structures often qualitatively match measured band structures, with notable systematic errors like band gap underestimation – more in Lecture 5).\n",
    "Spin-generalization: Real systems have electron spin. Spin-DFT (or LSDA) extends KS to two densities: $n_\\uparrow(r)$ and $n_\\downarrow(r)$ for spin-up and spin-down electrons. The HK theorems generalize to spin densities, and one defines $E[n_\\uparrow,n_\\downarrow]$ with exchange-correlation functional $E_{\\rm xc}[n_\\uparrow,n_\\downarrow]$. In practice, one often uses local spin-density approximation (LSDA) where $E_{\\rm xc}$ depends on $n_\\uparrow$ and $n_\\downarrow$ locally. The KS equations split for each spin channel with their own $V_{\\rm xc}^\\uparrow$ and $V_{\\rm xc}^\\downarrow$. Exchange energy, for example, is computed separately for each spin as it involves like-spin correlations .\n",
    "Summary: The Kohn–Sham formulation reduces the interacting $N$-electron problem to $N$ one-electron equations, provided we have a good approximation for $E_{\\rm xc}[n]$. This was a monumental shift – it allows using basis sets and algorithms from one-particle quantum mechanics (like plane waves, etc.) to handle many-electron systems with reasonable cost."

    "## Example: Hydrogen and Helium in Kohn–Sham DFT\n",
    "\n",
    "One-electron system (H atom): Consider a single hydrogen atom (one electron in the Coulomb potential of a proton). In this case, the KS approach is exact: if $N=1$, there is no electron–electron repulsion. The KS equation becomes $[-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 + V_{\\rm ext}(r)]\\psi_1 = \\epsilon_1 \\psi_1$, which is just the real Schrödinger equation for hydrogen. The ground-state density is $n(r)=|\\psi_{1s}(r)|^2$. Here, $V_{\\rm H}=0$ (no two electrons) and the exact $E_{\\rm xc}$ for one electron is zero (no exchange or correlation needed for a single electron). Indeed, $V_{\\rm xc}(r)=0$ in this case. The KS orbital $\\psi_{1s}(r)$ is the true 1s orbital, and $\\epsilon_{1s} = -13.6$ eV equals the ionization energy. This illustrates that for one-electron cases, DFT can be made exact with trivial XC functional.\n",
    "Two-electron system (He atom): The helium atom (two electrons in 1s orbital) is a simple case with electron–electron interaction. The exact ground-state energy of He is about $-79.0$ eV. A Hartree–Fock calculation (which includes exchange exactly but no true correlation) yields about $-77.5$ eV (missing the small correlation energy). Kohn–Sham DFT with a reasonable approximation (like the simplest LSDA) typically gives an energy around $-79$ eV, very close to the exact, illustrating that DFT can capture correlation effects efficiently through the XC functional. The KS orbitals in He end up similar to the HF 1s orbital; $V_{\\rm xc}(r)$ for helium (within LDA) is a negative potential in the shell region that effectively mimics the inter-electron repulsion reduction.\n",
    "Molecule example (H$_2$): In the H$_2$ molecule, two electrons form a covalent bond. KS DFT at the LDA or GGA level can predict a reasonable H–H bond length and binding energy (with small errors, e.g. LDA often slightly overbinds). The two 1s electrons are put into KS orbitals (bonding and anti-bonding). The KS HOMO–LUMO gap is not exactly the true H$_2$ excitation energy but is related. We will revisit how different functionals perform for molecules in Lecture 5.\n",
    "These simple examples show that Kohn–Sham’s division of the energy (and inclusion of an approximate $E_{\\rm xc}$) can recover a large portion of the missing many-body effects. The accuracy depends on the quality of $E_{\\rm xc}[n]$. We now turn to exploring common choices for $E_{\\rm xc}$ in the next lecture."

    "where $\\varepsilon_{\\xc}(n)$ is the XC energy per electron of a uniform electron gas of density $n$. So essentially, LDA treats each point in the material as if it were part of a homogeneous electron gas with that local density.\n",
    "Origin: The homogeneous electron gas (HEG) is one of the rare many-body systems we can solve (with quantum Monte Carlo, etc.). For a given uniform density $n$, the exchange energy per electron is known analytically (Dirac, 1930):\n",
    "\\varepsilon_x(n) = -\\frac{3}{4}\\left(\\frac{3}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/3} \\frac{e^2 n^{1/3}}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0} \\quad \\text{(in SI units, or = $-0.458\\, r_s^{-1}$ Ry in atomic units)}.\n",
    "The correlation energy per electron $\\varepsilon_c(n)$ was tabulated via Monte Carlo by Ceperley and Alder (1980) and fit by Perdew–Zunger (1981) – providing a practical formula for $\\varepsilon_c(n)$ for all densities.\n",
    "Successes of LDA: In the 1970s–80s, LDA proved surprisingly successful for solids and simple metals. It tends to give reasonably good electron densities and total energies, often canceling errors between exchange and correlation. For many solids, LDA predicts lattice constants within a few percent of experiment and bulk modulus within ~10%. For example, LDA for silicon gives a lattice constant slightly smaller than experiment (overbinding), but within ~1-2% .\n",
    "Systematic errors: LDA, however, is not very accurate for molecules (it overbinds molecules by about 1 eV per bond on average ). It also underestimates bond lengths (making them too short) and overestimates vibrational frequencies. In extended systems, LDA typically underestimates band gaps of semiconductors (often giving 30-50% smaller gaps or even falsely predicting a metallic state for some insulators).\n",
    "Why LDA works or fails: LDA has no knowledge of density gradients or molecule-specific effects. It works best when the system’s density varies slowly or is close to homogeneous (like simple metals). It fails when density is highly inhomogeneous or when delicate bonding/angle preferences occur (where gradients matter) or in systems where long-range correlation (van der Waals) is important, since a uniform-gas approximation can’t capture those."

Others include BLYP (Becke exchange + Lee-Yang-Parr correlation) which is popular in quantum chemistry, PW91 (an earlier Perdew–Wang 1991 GGA), etc. In GGA, the exchange energy density is modified from the LDA form by a factor depending on the gradient $ = |\\nabla n|/(2k_F n)$ (reduced gradient), and similarly correlation gets a gradient correction.\n",

Hydrogen bonds and weak interactions are still not perfect, but better than LDA .\n",

It’s observed that experimental lattice constants often lie between LDA (too low) and GGA (too high) . Bulk moduli are slightly underestimated in GGA (since the volume is larger).\n",

    "Strongly correlated electron systems (e.g. Mott insulators, some transition metal oxides) are still poorly described (GGA often predicts them metallic unless an empirical $U$ correction is added).\n",

    "Spin in LDA/GGA: In spin-polarized cases, one uses LSDA or GGA that are functions of $n_\\uparrow, n_\\downarrow$ (often constructed by applying LDA/GGA for each spin channel).

    "where $E_x^{\\rm HF}$ is the exact exchange energy from the KS orbitals (non-local), and $a$ is a mixing coefficient (commonly 20-2$5\\%$). B3LYP is a famous hybrid in chemistry (with $a\\approx 0.2$ plus some empirical parameters in correlation), and PBE0 is a hybrid with $a=0.25$ (25$\\%$ exact exchange) based on PBE. Hybrids significantly improve molecular properties: they give much better reaction energy barriers, atomization energies, and often better equilibrium structures.\n",
    "Why hybrids help: By adding exact exchange, hybrids correct the tendency of LDA/GGA to over-stabilize electron-rich regions. They also open up band gaps for insulators/semiconductors compared to LDA/GGA. For example, PBE (a GGA) predicts Si band gap ~0.6 eV while experiment is 1.1 eV; a hybrid like HSE (screened hybrid) or PBE0 might predict ~0.9–1.2 eV, much closer . In fact, the popular B3LYP functional was one reason DFT became widely used in quantum chemistry – it achieves “chemical accuracy” (~0.1 eV error) for many thermochemical properties  .\n",
    "Cost of hybrids: The inclusion of exact exchange makes calculations more expensive (scaling roughly like Hartree–Fock, $O(N^4)$ with system size, rather than $O(N^3)$ for pure DFT). In extended systems (3D solids), exact exchange is particularly costly, though screened hybrids (like HSE06) make it more tractable by damping long-range exchange.\n",
    "Empirical vs non-empirical: Some functionals (like B3LYP) had parameters fit to a training set of molecules, whereas PBE, SCAN, etc., are “non-empirical” (built from known physical constraints). Both approaches exist; empirical functionals can sometimes be very accurate for the types of systems they were fit to but might be less transferable.\n",
    "Functional performance: Over the decades, improvement is incremental. For instance, GGA significantly improved over LDA by late 1980s ; hybrids in the 1990s improved further. Yet some problems remain challenging (van der Waals, strong correlation). Many newer functionals aim at specialized fixes (like DFT-D for dispersion, DFT+U for correlations – to be discussed below)."

    "## Basis Sets for Solving the Kohn–Sham Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "Why a basis? The KS equations are differential equations that generally have no closed-form solution except for the simplest systems. To solve them on a computer, we choose a basis set to expand the KS orbitals $\\psi_i(\\mathbf{r})$. Common basis choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "Plane-wave basis: $\\displaystyle \\psi_i(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{G}} c_{i,\\mathbf{G}}, e^{i\\mathbf{G}\\cdot \\mathbf{r}}$. Here $\\mathbf{G}$ are reciprocal lattice vectors (for a periodic system, plane waves naturally incorporate Bloch’s theorem). We use plane waves especially in solid-state calculations with periodic boundary conditions. Plane waves are an unbiased, orthonormal basis covering the whole space  . A plane-wave basis doesn’t depend on atomic positions (no basis set superposition error), and forces can be computed easily using Hellmann–Feynman (no Pulay forces) . We include all plane waves up to a kinetic energy cutoff $E_{\\rm cut} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}|\\mathbf{G}|^2_{\\max}$. This single parameter controls basis completeness .\n",
    "Atomic-like orbitals: e.g. Gaussian functions or numerical atomic orbitals centered on atoms. Common in quantum chemistry, e.g. Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) – basis functions of form $\\chi_{\\mu}(\\mathbf{r}) = x^l y^m z^n e^{-\\alpha r^2}$, which are localized around atoms. These are efficient for molecules (fewer basis functions than plane waves for isolated systems) but require careful choice (basis sets of increasing size: double-zeta, triple-zeta, etc. to approach completeness).\n",
    "Augmented / others: Augmented plane waves (APW, LAPW), wavelets, real-space grids, etc. Linearized APW+lo and similar methods mix local functions with plane waves for better convergence on all-electron problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "All-electron vs. valence-only: Plane waves are poorly suited to representing the rapid oscillations of core electron wavefunctions near nuclei (would require extremely high $E_{\\rm cut}$). Similarly, including core states in molecular calculations can be unnecessary (they don’t participate in bonding significantly). This leads to the use of pseudopotentials or effective core potentials to remove core electrons from consideration.\n",
    "Basis set convergence: In any method, we must converge results with respect to basis size. Plane waves have a clear parameter $E_{\\rm cut}$ to increase; atomic orbitals have to go to higher zeta levels and include polarization/diffuse functions. An incomplete basis can introduce errors (variational principle ensures energy is above true minimum for exact functional). For plane waves, completeness is systematically improvable by raising $E_{\\rm cut}$ .\n",
    "Comparison: Plane waves treat periodic systems uniformly and are convenient for solids. Local orbitals are very efficient for molecules (much fewer basis functions required typically). Plane waves plus pseudopotentials have become the standard in materials science due to ease of achieving convergence and automating calculations."

    "## Pseudopotentials and Treating Core Electrons\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose of pseudopotentials: In a heavy atom, core electrons occupy small, tightly bound orbitals with many nodes (oscillations). Including them in a plane-wave calculation would demand an extremely high cutoff to resolve those oscillations  . Yet core electrons hardly affect chemical bonding (they’re essentially inert, providing just an effective nuclear charge for valence). Pseudopotentials allow us to replace the strong nuclear + core potential with a gentler effective potential that acts on valence electrons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Removes core electrons: They are not explicitly included; one uses a frozen core approximation. The number of electrons $N$ in the KS equations is then just the valence count.\n",
    "Smooths valence wavefunctions: The valence orbitals are forced to have no radial nodes inside a chosen cutoff radius. The pseudopotential is constructed so that outside the core radius, the pseudo-wavefunction matches the real all-electron wavefunction .\n",
    "\n",
    "How it’s done: A pseudopotential $V_{\\rm PS}(r)$ is generated (often by solving an atomic all-electron problem, then smoothing the potential inside). It typically comes in forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Norm-conserving pseudopotentials: ensure that the integrated charge of pseudo vs all-electron wavefunction matches inside the cutoff radius. These require higher cutoffs for first-row elements and transition metals often.\n",
    "Ultrasoft pseudopotentials: allow partial norm violation but include correction terms; this permits even softer (lower cutoff) potentials.\n",
    "Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) method: a modern approach that is effectively an all-electron + pseudopotential hybrid. PAW reconstructs the all-electron wavefunction via linear combination of smooth partial waves and atom-centered corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits: Using pseudopotentials drastically reduces the plane-wave basis size required . For example, a carbon atom with all-electron 1s core needs maybe 1000 eV plane-wave cutoff to capture 1s oscillation, but with a pseudopotential, one can use ~400 eV and omit the 1s entirely. It also simplifies the Hamiltonian by removing core-core interactions (which just become a constant reference energy).\n",
    "Transferability: A good pseudopotential reproduces scattering properties of the true potential for valence electrons in different environments. Pseudopotentials are tested on isolated atoms and sometimes fitted slightly to known properties (non-empirical ones are derived to match atomic spectra).\n",
    "In practice: Codes like VASP, Quantum ESPRESSO, ABINIT, etc., rely on plane-wave + pseudopotential. Chemistry codes (Gaussian, ORCA) typically use all-electron atomic bases for lighter elements, but for very heavy elements might use effective core potentials (ECPs, similar concept to pseudopotential).\n",
    "Example: For Si (with core [Ne]), a typical norm-conserving pseudopotential treats 4 valence electrons (3s²3p²) explicitly. The 1s, 2s, 2p are frozen in the potential. This yields excellent accuracy for bonding in silicon while using a moderate basis. If one tried all-electron with plane waves, it would be extremely inefficient."

    "Initial guess: Start with an initial electron density $n^{(0)}(\\mathbf{r})$. This could be a superposition of atomic densities or uniform electron gas or even random (in practice, educated guesses help convergence).\n",
    "Build Hamiltonian: Compute $V_{\\rm H}n^{(k)}$ from the current density (solve Poisson’s equation) and $V_{\\xc}n^{(k)}$ from the chosen functional. Form the effective potential $V_{\\rm eff}^{(k)}(r) = V_{\\rm ext}(r) + V_{\\rm H}^{(k)}(r) + V_{\\xc}^{(k)}(r)$.\n",
    "Solve KS equations: Solve $\\big(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 + V_{\\rm eff}^{(k)}(r)\\big)\\psi_i^{(k)}(r) = \\epsilon_i^{(k)} \\psi_i^{(k)}(r)$ for the orbitals. In practice, this means diagonalizing the Hamiltonian matrix in the chosen basis (e.g. plane-wave basis yields a matrix eigenvalue problem). Obtain a new set of orbitals ${\\psi_i^{(k)}}$.\n",
    "Update density: Compute new density $n^{(k+1)}(r) = \\sum_{i \\in \\text{occupied}} |\\psi_i^{(k)}(r)|^2$. For zero-temperature calculations, we fill the lowest $N$ orbitals (or use Fermi-Dirac occupation if metals/finite-$T$).\n",
    "Mixing: The new density $n^{(k+1)}$ might not be used directly; typically one mixes it with the old density to damp oscillations:\n",
    "n^{(k+1)} \\leftarrow n^{(k)} + \\alpha\\big(n_{\\text{new}}^{(k+1)} - n^{(k)}\\big)\\,,\n",
    "where $\\alpha$ is a mixing parameter (e.g. 0.2). More sophisticated schemes (Pulay’s DIIS method, Broyden mixing) construct an optimized mix of several previous iterations to accelerate convergence  .\n",
    "Convergence check: Compare $n^{(k+1)}(r)$ with $n^{(k)}(r)$ (or total energies or potentials). If the change (error) is below a set threshold (e.g. $10^{-5}$), the SCF cycle has converged to self-consistency. If not, go back to step 2 with $k \\leftarrow k+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convergence behavior: SCF is essentially a fixed-point iteration for $n = D[V(n)]$, where $D$ is the operation “solve KS and get new $n$” . Convergence is not always trivial: for insulating systems it’s usually straightforward, for metals or problematic cases one may need small $\\alpha$ or special mixing (because of charge sloshing or near-instabilities). Mathematically, the mixing scheme seeks to ensure the error $e_{n+1} = e_n - \\alpha P^{-1}(D(V(n)) - n)$ gets smaller  , where $P$ is a preconditioner (e.g. weighting Fourier components of density to damp low-frequency oscillations that cause charge sloshing).\n",
    "SCF algorithms: Common methods include simple linear mixing (as above), Anderson mixing (Pulay’s method) which builds a linear combination of past updates that minimizes residual, and more advanced ones like convergence acceleration by damping high-frequency components or using Kerker preconditioning for plane waves (which addresses the divergence of Coulomb interaction at $q\\to0$ for metals).\n",
    "Output of SCF: Once converged, we have the self-consistent $n(r)$ and $V_{\\rm eff}(r)$. We then compute the final energy $E_{\\rm KS}[n]$, and we can also compute forces on atoms via the Hellmann–Feynman theorem (with corrections if basis not exactly complete, like Pulay forces for incomplete basis sets)."

    "## Computational Scaling and Practical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Scaling with system size: The main cost is solving for eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. If we have $M$ basis functions (size of Hamiltonian matrix), diagonalization naïvely costs $O(M^3)$ operations. In plane-wave codes, $M$ grows roughly linearly with volume and as the cube of the cutoff (for 3D), and linearly with number of $k$-points (for Brillouin zone sampling). Modern methods like iterative diagonalization (Davidson or Lanczos) target only the lowest $N$ eigenstates and exploit sparsity or FFTs for applying $H$. Still, overall solving KS scales ~ $O(N \\cdot M^2)$ or so in practice, which is typically $O(N^3)$ scaling with number of electrons $N$ if $M \\propto N$.\n",
    "Memory and parallelization: Plane-wave codes use FFTs to switch between real-space (to apply $V_{\\rm eff}(r)$ multiplication) and reciprocal space (to apply $-\\nabla^2$ easily as multiplication by $-|\\mathbf{G}|^2$). These FFTs and linear algebra (BLAS/LAPACK) operations parallelize well. Large-scale DFT can handle hundreds to thousands of atoms using supercomputers, but memory and CPU time can become limiting for extremely large cells.\n",
    "Integral evaluation in localized basis: In all-electron codes (Gaussian basis), the bottleneck is often computing two-electron integrals and Fock matrix formation, which can scale $O(N^4)$ with naive algorithms (though density fitting and other tricks can reduce this). KS-DFT in Gaussian basis is usually faster than HF because we avoid the $N^4$ exchange integral calculation by using density functionals (which scale as $N^2$ or $N^3$).\n",
    "Accuracy vs speed: One often must choose convergence parameters carefully:\n",
    "\n",
    "Plane-wave cutoff: choose high enough that total energy is converged to say < meV/atom. For ultrasoft pseudopotentials or PAW, one may also need an augmentation charge grid.\n",
    "$k$-point sampling: for periodic solids, integrate over Brillouin zone; metals need finer $k$ meshes or smearing of occupations (Methfessel-Paxton, Gaussian smearing) to achieve SCF convergence and accurate partial occupancies.\n",
    "Basis set superposition error (BSSE): in local basis, ghost atom functions can cause overbinding errors in molecules (can be corrected with counterpoise method if needed). Plane waves don’t have BSSE by construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Force and stress calculations: Once SCF converged, forces $-dE/d\\mathbf{R}$ are computed. With complete basis or with Pulay corrections for incomplete basis, one can relax atomic positions. The stress tensor can be computed for variable-cell relaxation (important for finding equilibrium lattice parameters).\n",
    "DFT software examples: VASP, Quantum ESPRESSO, ABINIT (plane-wave + pseudopotential), WIEN2k (APW all-electron), Gaussian, ORCA, NWChem (molecular Gaussian basis all-electron), SIESTA, OpenMX (localized numerical orbitals + pseudopotentials), CP2K (mixed Gaussian & plane-wave), etc. All implement the SCF loop and differ mainly in how they represent orbitals and handle integrals."

    "\n",
    "Motivation: Ground-state DFT (HK theorem) handles only ground-state properties. To study optical excitations, electron dynamics, or excited states, we turn to Time-Dependent DFT. TDDFT extends DFT to the time domain for evolving an interacting system in a time-dependent potential $V_{\\rm ext}(\\mathbf{r}, t)$.\n",
    "Runge–Gross Theorem (1984): The TDDFT analog of HK: For a given initial many-body state $\\Psi_0$ at $t=0$, the time-dependent density $n(\\mathbf{r},t)$ uniquely determines the time-dependent external potential $V_{\\rm ext}(\\mathbf{r},t)$ (up to an additive purely time-dependent function) . This means all time-dependent observables are functionals of $n(\\mathbf{r},t)$. It establishes existence of a map $n(\\mathbf{r},t) \\to \\Psi(t)$ in principle.\n",

    "Here $V_{\\xc}n$ is the time-dependent XC potential, which must be approximated (with memory of past densities in general).\n",
    "Linear response and excitation energies: The most common use of TDDFT is linear response theory to compute excitation spectra. One perturbs the system with a small time-dependent field and finds how $n(\\mathbf{r},t)$ responds. This leads to the Casida equations for excitation energies: basically an eigenvalue equation in the space of orbital transitions:\n",

    "## Example: van der Waals Complex and Machine-Learned Functional\n",
    "\n",
    "van der Waals complex: Consider the interaction of two benzene molecules (π–π stacking). LDA or PBE will predict almost no binding (it might even show a very slight repulsion) because they miss dispersion. However, an approach like DFT-D (PBE+D3 by Grimme) adds empirical $C_6/r^6$ terms and yields a binding energy ~2 kcal/mol at a certain separation, roughly in line with high-level calculations. Nonlocal vdW-DF functionals (like vdW-DF2) also predict a binding, though often bond lengths and energies can be off by 10-20$\\%$. Still, this was a huge step forward to treat, e.g., layered materials: using vdW-DF, one can get the correct layer separation of graphite, whereas PBE would predict the layers unbound or much too far apart.\n",
    "SCAN functional performance: SCAN meta-GGA has been shown to improve a lot of energetic and structural predictions: e.g., it can simultaneously give good lattice constants (like PBE level) and good atomization energies (like hybrid level) for molecules, and even handle intermediate spin states better. For water, SCAN yields more accurate hydrogen bond strengths than PBE, improving the structure of liquid water in molecular dynamics. However, meta-GGAs can be sensitive (convergence issues) and sometimes overfit certain cases (some crystalline phase diagrams show slight anomalies with SCAN).\n",
    "Machine-learned functional (example): Recently, functionals like DeepMind’s DM21 combine a neural network with physical constraints to approximate $E_{\\xc}$. They train on a database of molecular energies including difficult cases (like stretched bonds). Preliminary results show improvement in challenging cases (like getting correct dissociation curves where standard DFT fails). Another example is Delta-learning: starting from a baseline functional and having ML predict the correction to energies. These functionals are just emerging, and while promising, need broad testing to ensure they don’t break known exact constraints or behave erratically outside the training set.\n",
    "Quantum computing and DFT: A speculative frontier – using quantum computers to solve for the electron density or for parts of the problem. There’s research into quantum algorithms for linear response of DFT or embedding a small strongly-correlated part on a quantum device (quantum-classical hybrid).\n",
    "Summary of Lecture Series: We began with the theoretical bedrock (HK theorems, KS scheme), moved through practical approximations (LDA, GGA, etc.), learned how calculations are set up and run (basis, SCF), and saw examples of DFT’s power and pitfalls. Finally, we see DFT is not static – it’s an evolving field. Improvements in functional design and integrations with other methods continue to extend the reach of DFT, tackling new problems and increasing accuracy for the challenging ones. Armed with this knowledge, one can critically use DFT in research, understanding when it will likely succeed and when caution or beyond-DFT methods are required."
