===== Hartree-Fock ground state energy for the  electron gas in three dimensions =====

We consider a system of electrons in infinite matter, the so-called electron gas. This is a homogeneous system and the one-particle states are given by plane wave function normalized to a volume $V$ 
for a box with length $L$ (the limit $L\rightarrow \infty$ is to be taken after we have computed various expectation values)
!bt
\[
\psi_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}(\mathbf{r})= \frac{1}{\sqrt{V}}\exp{(i\mathbf{kr})}\xi_{\sigma}
\]
!et
where $\mathbf{k}$ is the wave number and  $\xi_{\sigma}$ is a spin function for either spin up or down
!bt
\[ 
\xi_{\sigma=+1/2}=\left(\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \end{array}\right) \hspace{0.5cm}
\xi_{\sigma=-1/2}=\left(\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \end{array}\right).
\]
!et

!split
===== Periodic boundary conditions   =====

We assume that we have periodic boundary conditions which limit the allowed wave numbers to
!bt
\[
k_i=\frac{2\pi n_i}{L}\hspace{0.5cm} i=x,y,z \hspace{0.5cm} n_i=0,\pm 1,\pm 2, \dots
\]
!et
We assume first that the particles interact via a central, symmetric and translationally invariant
interaction  $V(r_{12})$ with
$r_{12}=|\mathbf{r}_1-\mathbf{r}_2|$.  The interaction is spin independent.


!split
===== Total Hamiltonian  =====

The total Hamiltonian consists then of kinetic and potential energy
!bt
\[
\hat{H} = \hat{T}+\hat{V}.
\]
!et
The operator for the kinetic energy is given by
!bt
\[
\hat{T}=\sum_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}\frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m}a_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}^{\dagger}a_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Exercise: Express interaction using creation and annihilation operators  =====

Find the expression for the interaction
$\hat{V}$ expressed with creation and annihilation operators.

The expression for the interaction
has to be written in  $k$ space, even though $V$ depends only on the relative distance. It means that you need to set up the Fourier transform $\langle \mathbf{k}_i\mathbf{k}_j| V | \mathbf{k}_m\mathbf{k}_n\rangle$.

A general two-body interaction element is given by (not using anti-symmetrized matrix elements)
!bt
\[ 
\hat{V} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{pqrs} \langle pq \hat{v} \vert rs\rangle a_p^\dagger a_q^\dagger a_s a_r ,  
\]
!et
where $\hat{v}$ is assumed to depend only on the relative distance between two interacting particles, that is
$\hat{v} = v(\vec r_1, \vec r_2) = v(|\vec r_1 - \vec r_2|) = v(r)$, with $r = |\vec r_1 - \vec r_2|$). 


!split
===== With spin degrees of freedom  =====

In our case we have, writing out explicitely the spin degrees of freedom as well
!bt
\begin{equation}
\hat{V} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{\substack{\sigma_p \sigma_q \\ \sigma_r \sigma_s}}
\sum_{\substack{\mathbf{k}_p \mathbf{k}_q \\ \mathbf{k}_r \mathbf{k}_s}}
\langle \mathbf{k}_p \sigma_p, \mathbf{k}_q \sigma_2\vert v \vert \mathbf{k}_r \sigma_3, \mathbf{k}_s \sigma_s\rangle
a_{\mathbf{k}_p \sigma_p}^\dagger a_{\mathbf{k}_q \sigma_q}^\dagger a_{\mathbf{k}_s \sigma_s} a_{\mathbf{k}_r \sigma_r} .
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== Plane waves  =====

Inserting plane waves as eigenstates we can rewrite the matrix element as
!bt
\[ 
\langle \mathbf{k}_p \sigma_p, \mathbf{k}_q \sigma_q\vert \hat{v} \vert \mathbf{k}_r \sigma_r, \mathbf{k}_s \sigma_s\rangle =
\frac{1}{V^2} \delta_{\sigma_p \sigma_r} \delta_{\sigma_q \sigma_s}
\int\int \exp{-i(\mathbf{k}_p \cdot \mathbf{r}_p)} \exp{-i( \mathbf{k}_q \cdot \mathbf{r}_q)} \hat{v}(r) \exp{i(\mathbf{k}_r \cdot \mathbf{r}_p)} \exp{i( \mathbf{k}_s \cdot \mathbf{r}_q)} d\mathbf{r}_p d\mathbf{r}_q , \]
!et
where we have used the orthogonality properties of the spin functions. We change now the variables of integration
by defining $\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_p - \mathbf{r}_q$, which gives $\mathbf{r}_p = \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{r}_q$ and $d^3 \mathbf{r} = d^3 \mathbf{r}_p$.

!split
===== Integration limits  =====

The limits are not changed since they are from $-\infty$ to  $\infty$ for all integrals. This results in
!bt
\begin{align*}
\langle \mathbf{k}_p \sigma_p, \mathbf{k}_q \sigma_q\vert \hat{v} \vert \mathbf{k}_r \sigma_r, \mathbf{k}_s \sigma_s\rangle
&= \frac{1}{V^2} \delta_{\sigma_p \sigma_r} \delta_{\sigma_q \sigma_s} \int\exp{i (\mathbf{k}_s - \mathbf{k}_q) \cdot \mathbf{r}_q} \int v(r) \exp{i(\mathbf{k}_r - \mathbf{k}_p) \cdot ( \mathbf{r} + \mathbf{r}_q)} d\mathbf{r} d\mathbf{r}_q \\
&= \frac{1}{V^2} \delta_{\sigma_p \sigma_r} \delta_{\sigma_q \sigma_s} \int v(r) \exp{i\left[(\mathbf{k}_r - \mathbf{k}_p) \cdot \mathbf{r}\right]}
\int \exp{i\left[(\mathbf{k}_s - \mathbf{k}_q + \mathbf{k}_r - \mathbf{k}_p) \cdot \mathbf{r}_q\right]} d\mathbf{r}_q d\mathbf{r} .
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Recognizing integral  =====

We recognize the integral over $\mathbf{r}_q$ as a $\delta$-function, resulting in
!bt
\[ \langle \mathbf{k}_p \sigma_p, \mathbf{k}_q \sigma_q\vert \hat{v} \vert \mathbf{k}_r \sigma_r, \mathbf{k}_s \sigma_s\rangle =
\frac{1}{V} \delta_{\sigma_p \sigma_r} \delta_{\sigma_q \sigma_s} \delta_{(\mathbf{k}_p + \mathbf{k}_q),(\mathbf{k}_r + \mathbf{k}_s)} \int v(r) \exp{i\left[(\mathbf{k}_r - \mathbf{k}_p) \cdot \mathbf{r}\right]} d^3r . \]
!et
For this equation to be different from zero, we must have conservation of momenta, we need to satisfy
$\mathbf{k}_p + \mathbf{k}_q = \mathbf{k}_r + \mathbf{k}_s$.


!split
===== Conservation of momentum  =====

We can use the conservation of momenta to remove one of the summation variables resulting in
!bt
\[ \hat{V} =
\frac{1}{2V} \sum_{\sigma \sigma'} \sum_{\mathbf{k}_p \mathbf{k}_q \mathbf{k}_r} \left[ \int v(r) \exp{i\left[(\mathbf{k}_r - \mathbf{k}_p) \cdot \mathbf{r}\right]} d^3r \right]
a_{\mathbf{k}_p \sigma}^\dagger a_{\mathbf{k}_q \sigma'}^\dagger a_{\mathbf{k}_p + \mathbf{k}_q - \mathbf{k}_r, \sigma'} a_{\mathbf{k}_r \sigma}, \]
!et
which can be rewritten as 
!bt
\begin{equation}
\hat{V} =
\frac{1}{2V} \sum_{\sigma \sigma'} \sum_{\mathbf{k} \mathbf{p} \mathbf{q}} \left[ \int v(r) \exp{-i( \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{r})} d\mathbf{r} \right]
a_{\mathbf{k} + \mathbf{q}, \sigma}^\dagger a_{\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}, \sigma'}^\dagger a_{\mathbf{p} \sigma'} a_{\mathbf{k} \sigma},
label{eq:V}
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== Some definitions  =====

In the last equation we defined
the quantities
$\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{k}_p + \mathbf{k}_q - \mathbf{k}_r$, $\mathbf{k} = \mathbf{k}_r$ og $\mathbf{q} = \mathbf{k}_p - \mathbf{k}_r$.

!split
===== Reference energy  =====

Let us now compute the expectation value of the reference energy using the expressions for the kinetic energy operator and the interaction.
We need to compute $\langle \Phi_0\vert \hat{H} \vert \Phi_0\rangle = \langle \Phi_0\vert \hat{T} \vert \Phi_0\rangle + \langle \Phi_0\vert \hat{V} \vert \Phi_0\rangle$, where $\vert \Phi_0\rangle$ is our reference Slater determinant, constructed from filling all single-particle states up to the Fermi level.
Let us start with the kinetic energy first
!bt
\[ \langle \Phi_0\vert \hat{T} \vert \Phi_0\rangle 
= \langle \Phi_0\vert \left( \sum_{\mathbf{p} \sigma} \frac{\hbar^2 p^2}{2m} a_{\mathbf{p} \sigma}^\dagger a_{\mathbf{p} \sigma} \right) \vert \Phi_0\rangle
= \sum_{\mathbf{p} \sigma} \frac{\hbar^2 p^2}{2m} \langle \Phi_0\vert a_{\mathbf{p} \sigma}^\dagger a_{\mathbf{p} \sigma} \vert \Phi_0\rangle . \]
!et

!split
===== Kinetic  energy  =====

From the possible contractions using Wick's theorem, it is straightforward to convince oneself that the expression for the kinetic energy becomes
!bt
\[ \langle \Phi_0\vert \hat{T} \vert \Phi_0\rangle = \sum_{\mathbf{i} \leq F} \frac{\hbar^2 k_i^2}{m} = \frac{V}{(2\pi)^3} \frac{\hbar^2}{m} \int_0^{k_F} k^2 d\mathbf{k}.
\]
!et
The sum of the spin degrees of freedom results in  a factor of two only if we deal with identical spin $1/2$ fermions. 
Changing to spherical coordinates, the integral over the momenta $k$ results in the final expression
!bt
\[ \langle \Phi_0\vert \hat{T} \vert \Phi_0\rangle = \frac{V}{(2\pi)^3} \left( 4\pi \int_0^{k_F} k^4 d\mathbf{k} \right) = \frac{4\pi V}{(2\pi)^3} \frac{1}{5} k_F^5 = \frac{4\pi V}{5(2\pi)^3} k_F^5 = \frac{\hbar^2 V}{10\pi^2 m} k_F^5 . \]
!et


!split
===== Density of states  =====

The density of states in momentum space is given by $2V/(2\pi)^3$, where we have included the degeneracy due to the spin degrees of freedom.
The volume is given by  $4\pi k_F^3/3$, and the number of particles becomes
!bt
\[ N = \frac{2V}{(2\pi)^3} \frac{4}{3} \pi k_F^3 = \frac{V}{3\pi^2} k_F^3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad
k_F = \left( \frac{3\pi^2 N}{V} \right)^{1/3}. \]
!et
This gives us
!bt
\begin{equation}
\langle \Phi_0\vert \hat{T} \vert \Phi_0\rangle =
\frac{\hbar^2 V}{10\pi^2 m} \left( \frac{3\pi^2 N}{V} \right)^{5/3} =
\frac{\hbar^2 (3\pi^2)^{5/3} N}{10\pi^2 m} \rho^{2/3} ,
label{eq:T_forventning}
\end{equation}
!et

!split
===== Potential energy  =====

We are now ready to calculate the expectation value of the potential energy
!bt
\begin{align*}
\langle \Phi_0\vert \hat{V} \vert \Phi_0\rangle 
&= \langle \Phi_0\vert \left( \frac{1}{2V} \sum_{\sigma \sigma'} \sum_{\mathbf{k} \mathbf{p} \mathbf{q} } \left[ \int v(r) \exp{-i (\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{r})} d\mathbf{r} \right] a_{\mathbf{k} + \mathbf{q}, \sigma}^\dagger a_{\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}, \sigma'}^\dagger a_{\mathbf{p} \sigma'} a_{\mathbf{k} \sigma} \right) \vert \Phi_0\rangle \\
&= \frac{1}{2V} \sum_{\sigma \sigma'} \sum_{\mathbf{k} \mathbf{p} \mathbf{q}} \left[ \int v(r) \exp{-i (\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{r})} d\mathbf{r} \right]\langle \Phi_0\vert a_{\mathbf{k} + \mathbf{q}, \sigma}^\dagger a_{\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}, \sigma'}^\dagger a_{\mathbf{p} \sigma'} a_{\mathbf{k} \sigma} \vert \Phi_0\rangle .
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Non-zero term  =====

The only contractions which result in non-zero results are those that involve states below the Fermi level, that is 
$k \leq k_F$, $p \leq k_F$, $|\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q}| < \mathbf{k}_F$ and $|\mathbf{k} + \mathbf{q}| \leq k_F$. Due to momentum conservation we must also have $\mathbf{k} + \mathbf{q} = \mathbf{p}$, $\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q} = \mathbf{k}$ and  $\sigma = \sigma'$ or  $\mathbf{k} + \mathbf{q} = \mathbf{k}$ and $\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{q} = \mathbf{p}$. 
Summarizing, we must have
!bt
\[ \mathbf{k} + \mathbf{q} = \mathbf{p} \quad \text{and} \quad \sigma = \sigma', \qquad
\text{or} \qquad
\mathbf{q} = \mathbf{0} . \]
!et

!split
===== Direct and exchange terms  =====

We obtain then
!bt
\[ \langle \Phi_0\vert \hat{V} \vert \Phi_0\rangle =
\frac{1}{2V} \left( \sum_{\sigma \sigma'} \sum_{\mathbf{q} \mathbf{p} \leq F} \left[ \int v(r) d\mathbf{r} \right] - \sum_{\sigma}
\sum_{\mathbf{q} \mathbf{p} \leq F} \left[ \int v(r) \exp{-i (\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{r})} d\mathbf{r} \right] \right). \]
!et
The first term is the so-called direct term while the second term is the exchange term. 


!split
===== Potential energy  =====

We can rewrite this equation as (and this applies to any potential which depends only on the relative distance between particles)
!bt
\begin{equation}
\langle \Phi_0\vert \hat{V} \vert \Phi_0\rangle =
\frac{1}{2V} \left( N^2 \left[ \int v(r) d\mathbf{r} \right] - N \sum_{\mathbf{q}} \left[ \int v(r) \exp{-i (\mathbf{q}\cdot \mathbf{r})} d\mathbf{r} \right] \right),
label{eq:V_b}
\end{equation}
!et
where we have used the fact that a sum like $\sum_{\sigma}\sum_{\mathbf{k}}$ equals the number of particles. Using the fact that the density is given by
$\rho = N/V$, with $V$ being our volume, we can rewrite the last equation as
!bt
\[
\langle \Phi_0\vert \hat{V} \vert \Phi_0\rangle =
\frac{1}{2} \left( \rho N \left[ \int v(r) d\mathbf{r} \right] - \rho\sum_{\mathbf{q}} \left[ \int v(r) \exp{-i (\mathbf{q}\cdot \mathbf{r})} d\mathbf{r} \right] \right).
\]
!et

!split
===== Interaction part  =====

For the electron gas
the interaction part of the Hamiltonian operator is given by
!bt
\[
\hat{H}_I=\hat{H}_{el}+\hat{H}_{b}+\hat{H}_{el-b},
\]
!et
with the electronic part
!bt
\[
\hat{H}_{el}=\sum_{i=1}^N\frac{p_i^2}{2m}+\frac{e^2}{2}\sum_{i\ne j}\frac{e^{-\mu |\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_j|}}{|\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_j|},
\]
!et
where we have introduced an explicit convergence factor
(the limit $\mu\rightarrow 0$ is performed after having calculated the various integrals).

!split
===== Positive background  =====

Correspondingly, we have
!bt
\[
\hat{H}_{b}=\frac{e^2}{2}\int\int d\mathbf{r}d\mathbf{r}'\frac{n(\mathbf{r})n(\mathbf{r}')e^{-\mu |\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|}}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}'|},
\]
!et
which is the energy contribution from the positive background charge with density
$n(\mathbf{r})=N/V$. Finally,
!bt
\[
\hat{H}_{el-b}=-\frac{e^2}{2}\sum_{i=1}^N\int d\mathbf{r}\frac{n(\mathbf{r})e^{-\mu |\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{x}_i|}}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{x}_i|},
\]
!et
is the interaction between the electrons and the positive background.

!split
===== Positive charge contribution  =====

We can show that
!bt
\[
\hat{H}_{b}=\frac{e^2}{2}\frac{N^2}{V}\frac{4\pi}{\mu^2},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\hat{H}_{el-b}=-e^2\frac{N^2}{V}\frac{4\pi}{\mu^2}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Thermodynamic limit  =====

For the electron gas and a Coulomb interaction, these two terms are cancelled (in the thermodynamic limit) by the contribution from the direct term arising
from the repulsive electron-electron interaction. What remains then  when computing the reference energy is only the kinetic energy contribution and the contribution from the exchange term.  For other interactions, like nuclear forces with a short range part and no infinite range, we need to compute both the direct term and the exchange term. 

We can show that the final Hamiltonian can be written as 
!bt
\[
H=H_{0}+H_{I},
\]
!et
with
!bt
\[
H_{0}={\displaystyle\sum_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}}
\frac{\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m}a_{\mathbf{k}\sigma}^{\dagger}
a_{\mathbf{k}\sigma},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
H_{I}=\frac{e^{2}}{2V}{\displaystyle\sum_{\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}}}{\displaystyle\sum_{\mathbf{q}\neq 0,\mathbf{k},\mathbf{p}}}\frac{4\pi}{q^{2}}
a_{\mathbf{k}+\mathbf{q},\sigma_{1}}^{\dagger}
a_{\mathbf{p}-\mathbf{q},\sigma_{2}}^{\dagger}
a_{\mathbf{p}\sigma_{2}}a_{\mathbf{k}\sigma_{1}}.
\] 
!et

!split
===== Ground state energy =====
Calculate $E_0/N=\langle \Phi_{0}\vert H\vert \Phi_{0}\rangle/N$ for for this system to first order in the interaction. Show that, by using
!bt
\[
\rho= \frac{k_F^3}{3\pi^2}=\frac{3}{4\pi r_0^3},
\]
!et
with $\rho=N/V$, $r_0$
being the radius of a sphere representing the volume an electron occupies 
and the Bohr radius $a_0=\hbar^2/e^2m$, 
that the energy per electron can be written as 
!bt
\[
E_0/N=\frac{e^2}{2a_0}\left[\frac{2.21}{r_s^2}-\frac{0.916}{r_s}\right].
\]
!et
Here we have defined
$r_s=r_0/a_0$ to be a dimensionless quantity.

!split
===== Exercise: plot of energy  =====

Plot the energy as function of $r_s$. Why is this system stable?
Calculate thermodynamical quantities like the pressure, given by
!bt
\[
P=-\left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial V}\right)_N,
\]
!et
and the bulk modulus
!bt
\[
B=-V\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\right)_N,
\]
!et
and comment your results.


!split
===== Density functional theory =====


Hohenberg and Kohn proved that the total energy of a system including
that of the many-body effects of electrons (exchange and correlation)
in the presence of static external potential (for example, the atomic
nuclei) is a unique functional of the charge density. The minimum
value of the total energy functional is the ground state energy of the
system. The electronic charge density which yields this minimum is
then the exact single particle ground state energy.


!split
===== Functional of density  =====


The electronic energy $E$ is said to be a functional of the
electronic density, $E[\rho]$, in the sense that for a given function
$\rho(r)$, there is a single corresponding energy. The
Hohenberg-Kohn theorems (two) confirms that such a functional exists,
but does not tell us the form of the functional.

Density functional theory has turned out to be a resounding success. A
large majority of crystalline materials, many molecules and molecular
structures have been explained using DFT. Walter Kohn, involved in
both the Hohenberg-Kohn theory and development of the Kohn-Sham
equations, received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for DFT and
computational chemistry in 1998.  DFT is used in a broad spectrum of
disciplines, including quantum chemistry, materials science, condensed
matter physics and low-energy nuclear physics



!split
===== The many-particle equation =====

Any material on earth, whether in crystals, amorphous solids,
molecules or yourself, consists of nothing else than a bunch of atoms,
ions and electrons bound together by electric forces. All these
possible forms of matter can be explained by virtue of one simple
equation: the many-particle Schr\"{o}dinger equation,

!bt
\begin{equation}
	i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Phi( \bm{r} ; t) = 
	\left( - \sum_{i}^N \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_i} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \bm{r}_i^2}
	+ \sum_{i<j}^N \frac{e^2 Z_i Z_j }{ | \bm{r}_i - \bm{r}_j| } \right)  \Phi( \bm{r} ; t).
\end{equation}
!et

Here $\Phi(\bm{r} ; t)$ is the many-body wavefunction for $N$ particles, where each particle has its own mass $m_i$, charge $Z_i$ and position $\bm{r}_i$. The only interaction is the Coulomb interaction $e^2/r$. 


!split
===== Born-Oppenheimer approximation =====

In atomic and molecular physics, materials science and quantum chemsitry, the Born-Oppenheimer  approximation arises from the physical problem we want to
study: the ground state of a collection of interacting ions and
electrons. Because even the lightest ion is more than a thousand times
heavier than an electron, we approximate our Hamiltonian  to not include  the dynamics of the
ions all-together. This is known as the _Born-Oppenheimer_
approximation.


!split
===== Time-independent equation =====

We then write the time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger
equation for a collection of $N$ electrons subject to the
electric potential created by the fixed ions, labeled $v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\bm{r})$,

!bt
\[
	\left( \sum_{i}^N \left( - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \bm{r}_i^2}
	+ v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\bm{r}_i) \right)
	 + \sum_{i<j}^N \frac{e^2}{|\bm{r}_i - \bm{r}_j|} \right) \Psi(\bm{r}) = E_0  \Psi( \bm{r} ),
\]
!et
where $\bm{r}_i$ are the positions of the electrons.

We can replace the explicit Coulomb repulsion with a generic two-body interaction
!bt
\[
	\sum_{i}^N \left( - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \bm{r}_i^2}
	+ v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\bm{r}_i) \right)
	 + \sum_{i<j}^N v(r_{ij})( = E_0  \Psi( \bm{r} ),
\]
!et
where $r_{ij}=\vert \bm{r}_i-\bm{r}_j\vert$. 


!split
===== Potential term =====
The potential
$v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\bm{r}_i)$ is created by the charged ions,
!bt
\[
	v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\bm{r}_i) = - \sum_j \frac{e^2 Z_j}{| \bm{r}_i - \bm{R}_j|}
\]
!et
where $\bm{R}$ is the (static) positions of the ions and $Z_j$ their
charge.


!split
===== The one-body density =====
The one-body reduced density matrix of a many-body system at zero
temperature gives direct access to many observables, such as the charge density,
kinetic energy and occupation numbers. In a coordinate representation it is defined as
as the expectation value of the number operator
!bt
\[
\hat{n}(\bm{r})=\sum_{i=1}^N\delta(\bm{r}-\bm{r}_i),
\]
!et
resulting in 
!bt
\[
n(\bm{r})=\frac{\langle \Psi \vert \hat{n}(\bm{r}) \vert \Psi \rangle}{\langle \Psi\vert \Psi \rangle}.
\]
!et

Here $\Psi$ can be any state. In the equations that follow we assume it has been normalized properly.


!split
===== One-body density  =====

The one-body or just electronic density here, is thus obtained by integrating out all electron
degrees of freedom except one, that is (setting $\bm{r}=\bm{r}_1$)
!bt
\[
	n(\bm{r})=n(\bm{r}_1) = \int d^3 \bm{r}_2 \cdots d^3 \bm{r}_N
		\left| \Psi (\bm{r}_1 \cdots \bm{r}_n) \right|^2.
\]
!et

If $\Psi$ is a single reference Slater determinant defined in terms of the single-particle functions $\psi_i$, then we have 
!bt
\[
	n(\bm{r})=\sum_{i=1}^N\vert \psi_i(\bm{r})\vert^2,
\]
!et
as derived earlier. 

!split
===== Energy as function of the density =====

Text to come here.

!split
===== Hohenberg-Kohn theory =====

Assume we found a solution for the Hamiltonian from the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, with
ground state energy $E_0$ and a certain electronic density
$n(\bm{r})$. The strength of the Coulomb interaction and the mass of an
electron are constants of nature, so the only input that can possibly
influence the electronic density $n(\bm{r})$ and the energy $E_0$ of our
ground state is our choice of potential $v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\bm{r})$. In other words, the
ground state energy is a {\em functional} of the input potential,

!bt
\[
E_0 [v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\bm{r})] = \mathcal{F}_E[ v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\bm{r}) ]
\]
!et


!split
===== Energy functional =====
A functional is nothing else than a function whose input is another
function; in this case the functional $\mathcal{F}$ takes as input the
electric potential generated by the ions and outputs the ground state
energy based on thr Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

At first this results seems counterintuitive. After all, the ground
state energy clearly contains the kinetic energy $T$, the interaction
energy $U$ and the potential energy. Only the latter term 
explicitly depends on the potential. We can thus write the ground
state energy in terms of a separate functional for the kinetic and
interaction energy, and the potential energy


!split
===== How to find the functional =====
Knowing this functional, for any given potential $V(\bm{r})$ we minimize
the right hand side by checking all possible electronic density
distributions.


There are only two minor problems. We don't know what this functional
looks like. And even if we did, we don't know how to find the right
electronic density.

!split
===== Approximating the functional =====

The unknown functional $\mathcal{F}[n(\bm{r})]$ should describe the
kinetic and interaction energy of a system described by
for example the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Even though we cannot find its exact
shape, we can look at its shape in some limiting cases that we can
solve.

We know that a free homogeneous electron gas (HEG) with density $n$ has a
ground state energy of
!bt
\[
E_0 = \frac{3 \hbar^2 \left( 3 \pi^2 \right)^{2/3}}{10 m} n_0^{5/3}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Using the results from the HEG =====

For a slowly varying electronic density, we can approximate the
kinetic energy contribution to the full functional
$\mathcal{F}[n(\bm{r})]$ as the energy evaluated
at each point separately,

!bt
\[
	\mathcal{T}_0 [n(\bm{r})] =
	 \frac{3 \hbar^2 \left( 3 \pi^2 \right)^{2/3}}{10 m} \int  d^3\bm{r} ( n(\bm{r}) )^{5/3}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Hartree term to the energy =====

We have also earlier derived that the simplest 
energy contribution from Coulomb interactions is given by the Hartree
term

!bt
\[
	\mathcal{U}_{\mathrm{H}} [n(\bm{r})] = 
		\frac{e^2}{2} \int d^3\bm{r} d^3\bm{r}' \, \frac{n(\bm{r}) n(\bm{r}')}{|\bm{r} - \bm{r}'|}.
\]
!et


!split
===== Final functional =====

It is natural to write out the full functional as containing the
homogeneous electron gas term and the Hartree term. The remaining
terms, though still unknown, should be small. This unknown part is
conventionally called the {\em exchange-correlation potential}
$E_{xc}[n(\bm{r})]$. The full Hohenberg-Kohn functional, including the
potential energy, is thus

!bt
\[
	\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{HK}}[n(\bm{r})] = 
		\mathcal{T}_0 [n(\bm{r})]
		 + \int d^3 \bm{r} v_{\mathrm{ext}}(r) n(\bm{r})
		 + \mathcal{U}_{\mathrm{H}} [n(\bm{r})]
		 + E_{xc} [ n(\bm{r})].
\]
!et

!split
===== Kohn-Sham equation =====

We replaced an intractable problem with the task of minimizing an unknown
functional $\mathcal{F}[n(\bm{r})]$ over infinitely many possible
electronic densities $n(\bm{r})$. In the previous section we already gave
some first suggestions for the functional. But once we found it, how
to find the right electronic density $n(\bm{r})$?

Because the correct density minimizes the functional, we can find the
functional by setting it's derivative to zero,

!bt
\[
	\frac{\delta \mathcal{F}[n(\bm{r})] }{\delta n(\bm{r})} = 0.
\]
!et


!split
===== Kohn-Sham equations =====
Using the functional Eq(insert), we write
out

#\footnote{There is a small subtlety included in this equation: the
#kinetic component of the functional $\mathcal{T} [n(\bm{r})]$ should not
#be the one obtained for the free homogeneous noninteracting electron
#gas, but the one for a noninteracting gas subject
#to the Kohn-Sham potential.}

!bt
\[
	\frac{\delta \mathcal{T}[n(\bm{r})] }{\delta n(\bm{r})}
	+ v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\bm{r})
	+ \int \frac{n(\bm{r}')}{|\bm{r}-\bm{r}'|}d^3 \bm{r}'
	+ \frac{\delta E_{xc} [n(\bm{r})] }{\delta n(\bm{r})}
	=0.
\]
!et

!split
===== The equations =====
The idea of Kohn and Sham was to treat this as if it
is a single-particle problem. The first term represents the
kinetic energy, and the remaining terms form the Kohn-Sham potential

!bt
\[
	V_{\mathrm{KS}}(\bm{r}) = V(\bm{r})
	+ \int \frac{n(\bm{r}')}{|\bm{r}-\bm{r}'|}d^3 \bm{r}'
	+ \frac{\delta E_{xc} [n(\bm{r})] }{\delta n(\bm{r})}.
\]
!et
The Kohn-Sham equation is the single-particle Schr\"{o}dinger
equation with the potential given by the last equation,

!bt
\[
	\left( - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \bm{r}^2} + V_{\mathrm{KS}}(\bm{r}) \right) \psi_i(\bm{r}) = \epsilon_i \psi_i (\bm{r}).
\]
!et

!split
===== Numerical solution =====

The Kohn-Sham equations have to be solved numerically. As with our
discussions of Hartree-Fock theory, this is tractable because the
equations are just given by a set of coupled differential
equation. The electronic density is obtained by occupying the $N$
solutions $\psi_i(\bm{r})$ with the lowest energy,

!bt
\[
	n(\bm{r}) = \sum_{i=1}^N |\psi_i (\bm{r}) |^2.
\]
!et

Now the electronic density obtained this way can be used to calculate
a new Kohn-Sham potential. We
continue this iterative procedure until we reach convergence.

===== Many-Electron Problem & Hohenberg–Kohn Theorems =====


_Theorem I (HK1):_ For any many-electron system in an external potential $V_{\rm ext}(\mathbf{r})$, the potential is uniquely determined (up to an additive constant) by the ground-state electron density $n(\mathbf{r})$. Equivalently, the mapping $V_{\rm ext}(\mathbf{r}) \mapsto n(\mathbf{r})$ is one-to-one (for non-degenerate ground states) . This means no two different external potentials can yield the same ground-state density. As a corollary, the ground-state density $n(\mathbf{r})$ uniquely determines the full Hamiltonian (up to constant shift in energy) and thus all properties of the system .

_Theorem II (HK2):_ There exists a universal functional $F[n]$ such that for any $N$-electron density $n(\mathbf{r})$, the energy can be written as
!bt
\[
E[n] = F[n] + \int d^3r\,V_{\rm ext}(\mathbf{r})\,n(\mathbf{r}),
\]
!et
and the true ground-state density minimizes this energy functional. In other words,
!bt
\[
F[n] = T[n] + V_{\rm int}[n],
\]
!et
is a universal functional (the same for all systems, independent of $V_{\rm ext}$), and for the correct ground-state density $n_0(\mathbf{r})$, $E[n_0]$ is the global minimum of $E[n]$ . The minimum value equals the ground-state energy $E_0$.

_Corollary:_ The functional $E[n]$ is sufficient to obtain the exact ground-state energy and density . Excited states, however, are not obtained from this ground-state functional and must be accessed by other means (e.g. time-dependent DFT or other methods).

!split
===== Discussion: Consequences of HK Theorems =====

DFT exists in principle: HK1 establishes that the ground-state density is as fundamental as the wavefunction – it encapsulates all the information needed to determine the system’s Hamiltonian and thus all ground-state observables. This is a remarkable reduction: instead of a complicated wavefunction $\Psi$, we can work with $n(\mathbf{r})$.
Energy as a functional of density: HK2 guarantees an energy functional $E[n]$ exists. However, the theorems themselves do not provide an explicit form for $F[n] = T[n] + V_{\rm int}[n]$. They are existence theorems. The challenge of DFT (and much of this course) is how to approximate $F[n]$ in practice, especially the many-body terms hidden in it.
Variational principle: Given HK2, one can variationally obtain the ground state: if we had the exact $E[n]$ functional, minimizing $E[n]$ with respect to $n(\mathbf{r})$ (subject to $\int n(\mathbf{r}) d^3r = N$) yields the true ground-state density and energy. In formal terms, $\delta {E[n] - \mu(\int n - N)} / \delta n(\mathbf{r}) = 0$ leads to a condition $\frac{\delta E[n]}{\delta n(\mathbf{r})}\big|_{n=n_0} = \mu$ (constant Fermi level $\mu$ for the ground state).
Proof sketch of HK Theorem I: It’s instructive to see why two different potentials cannot give the same density. Suppose $V_{\rm ext}^{(1)}(\mathbf{r})$ and $V_{\rm ext}^{(2)}(\mathbf{r})$ yield the same ground-state density $n(\mathbf{r})$ but different ground-state wavefunctions $\Psi^{(1)}$ and $\Psi^{(2)}$. Let $E^{(1)}$ and $E^{(2)}$ be their ground-state energies. Without loss of generality, assume $E^{(1)} < E^{(2)}$. Then, using $\Psi^{(2)}$ in Hamiltonian 1: $E^{(1)} < \langle \Psi^{(2)}|\hat{H}^{(1)}|\Psi^{(2)}\rangle = \langle \Psi^{(2)}|\hat{H}^{(2)}|\Psi^{(2)}\rangle + \int [V_{\rm ext}^{(1)}(\mathbf{r})-V_{\rm ext}^{(2)}(\mathbf{r})],n(\mathbf{r}),d^3r = E^{(2)} + \int [V_{\rm ext}^{(1)}-V_{\rm ext}^{(2)}] n(\mathbf{r})$ . Similarly, exchanging 1↔2 leads to $E^{(2)} < E^{(1)} + \int [V_{\rm ext}^{(2)}-V_{\rm ext}^{(1)}] n(\mathbf{r})$ . Adding these two inequalities yields $E^{(1)} + E^{(2)} < E^{(1)} + E^{(2)}$, a contradiction. Thus $V_{\rm ext}^{(1)}$ and $V_{\rm ext}^{(2)}$ cannot produce the same $n(\mathbf{r})$. This proves the uniqueness (HK1).
Domain and $v$-representability: Not every arbitrary $n(\mathbf{r})$ is a valid ground-state density of some physical $V_{\rm ext}$ (this is the issue of $v$-representability). HK theorems assume $n(\mathbf{r})$ comes from some ground state of a Hamiltonian. Modern proofs (Levy–Lieb constrained search) circumvent some $v$-representability issues by considering minimization over all wavefunctions yielding a density $n$.
Implications: The ground-state energy can be obtained in principle by minimizing $E[n]$. However, without an expression for $F[n]$, one cannot perform this minimization in practice. Enter the Kohn–Sham approach (see below), which provides a clever way to approximate $F[n]$ using orbitals. 

!split
===== Example: Thomas–Fermi Approximation (Historical Perspective) =====

Before rigorous DFT, the Thomas–Fermi (TF) model (1927) was an early density-based theory. It modeled the kinetic energy of electrons in a homogeneous way: T_{\rm TF}[n] = \frac{3}{10}(3\pi^2)^{2/3} \int n^{5/3}(\mathbf{r})\,d^3r\,, and the electron–electron interaction via a Hartree term $E_{\rm H}[n] = \frac{e^2}{2}\int d^3r,d^3r’ ,\frac{n(\mathbf{r}),n(\mathbf{r}’)}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}’|}$. The total TF energy functional: E_{\rm TF}[n] = T_{\rm TF}[n] + E_{\rm H}[n] + \int V_{\rm ext} n(\mathbf{r})\,d^3r\,. Minimizing $E_{\rm TF}[n]$ for atoms gives a rough electron density profile. However, TF theory neglects shell structure and chemical bonding entirely (no exchange or true fermionic kinetic energy oscillations).
Significance: TF theory does not produce bound molecules (it predicts atoms just barely unbound) , indicating that the simplistic functional misses important physics (exchange and quantum oscillations). Nonetheless, it was a foundation that showed the promise of using $n(\mathbf{r})$ and inspired the development of DFT.
Modern DFT vs. TF: The Kohn–Sham method can be viewed as incorporating the missing quantum effects by using an effective single-particle approach (coming next). In effect, Kohn–Sham splits $F[n]$ into a large known part (non-interacting kinetic energy + Hartree) and a smaller unknown remainder (exchange-correlation) that can be approximated.
Preview of next lecture: How can we find the correct density without knowing the exact $F[n]$? The answer is the Kohn–Sham scheme, which introduces a fictitious non-interacting system that reproduces the same density. This yields tractable equations for orbitals, which, when solved self-consistently, give the ground-state density and energy.

!split
===== Kohn–Sham Formalism, the ansatz =====


Challenge: The HK theorems ensure an energy functional exists but don’t tell us its form. Direct use of $E[n]$ is impractical without approximations for $F[n] = T[n] + V_{\rm int}[n]$. Early attempts (like Thomas–Fermi) were too crude. We need a more accurate scheme to handle the kinetic and interaction energies.
Kohn–Sham idea (1965): Instead of trying to directly approximate the many-body kinetic energy $T[n]$ for interacting electrons, Kohn and Sham proposed to replace the real interacting system by an auxiliary non-interacting system of electrons that yields the same density $n(\mathbf{r})$ as the true system  . This fictitious system is easier to solve (since non-interacting electrons just occupy orbitals).
We introduce $N$ single-particle orbitals ${\psi_i(\mathbf{r})}$ (for $i=1,\dots,N$ for a spin-unpolarized system; we will generalize to spin later) such that n(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{i=1}^N |\psi_i(\mathbf{r})|^2\,, where each $\psi_i(\mathbf{r})$ is an orbital in the auxiliary system  . We assume these $N$ orbitals can be chosen as orthonormal and occupy the lowest $N$ energy levels of some effective single-particle Hamiltonian.
Non-interacting kinetic energy: We can exactly compute a kinetic energy for these orbitals: T_s[n] \equiv T_{\rm eff}[n] = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^N \int \psi_i^*(\mathbf{r})\,\nabla^2\,\psi_i(\mathbf{r})\,d^3r\,, which is the kinetic energy of non-interacting electrons with density $n(\mathbf{r})$ . $T_s[n]$ is generally not equal to the true kinetic energy $T[n]$ of the interacting system, but it will be the major part of it.
Decomposing the energy functional: We then write the total energy functional as E[n] = T_s[n] + E_{\rm H}[n] + E_{\rm xc}[n] + \int V_{\rm ext}(\mathbf{r})\,n(\mathbf{r})\,d^3r\,. Here $E_{\rm H}[n] = \frac{1}{2}\int!\int \frac{n(\mathbf{r}),n(\mathbf{r’})}{|\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r’}|} d^3r,d^3r’$ is the classical Hartree (Coulomb) energy of the electron distribution, and $E_{\rm xc}[n]$ is defined as the exchange–correlation energy, which by construction includes all the many-body effects not captured by $T_s$ and $E_{\rm H}$【28†match】 (see below for formal definition).
Essentially, $E_{\rm xc}[n]$ is a correction term: E_{\rm xc}[n] \equiv (T[n] - T_s[n]) + (V_{\rm int}[n] - E_{\rm H}[n])\,, i.e. it contains the difference between the true kinetic energy and the non-interacting kinetic energy plus the difference between the true electron–electron interaction energy and the simple Hartree term . In this way, if $E_{\rm xc}[n]$ were known exactly, DFT would be exact. All approximation difficulty is shoved into $E_{\rm xc}$. 

!split
===== Derivation of the Kohn–Sham Equations (Variational Method) =====

We now minimize the energy functional $E[n]$ with respect to the orbitals $\psi_i(\mathbf{r})$, subject to the constraint that $\int |\psi_i|^2 = 1$ (orthonormality for different $i$). This is equivalent to minimizing w.r.t. $n(\mathbf{r})$ but using the orbital representation ensures $n(\mathbf{r})$ is $v$-representable by some non-interacting system.
The Kohn–Sham energy functional (including all terms) can be written as: E[n] = T_s[n] + \int V_{\rm ext}(r)\,n(r)\,dr + E_{\rm H}[n] + E_{\rm xc}[n]\,, where we treat $E_{\rm H}$ and $E_{\rm xc}$ as explicit functionals of $n$ (and thus implicit of ${\psi_i}$). For brevity, denote E_{\rm other}[n] \equiv \int V_{\rm ext} n\,dr + E_{\rm H}[n] + E_{\rm xc}[n]\,.
We impose orthonormality via Lagrange multipliers $\epsilon_j$ (which will turn out to be the orbital energies). The Euler–Lagrange equation for minimizing $E[{\psi_i}] = T_s[{\psi_i}] + E_{\rm other}[n]$ is: \frac{\delta}{\delta \psi_i^(r)} \Big\{ T_s[\{\psi\}] + E_{\rm other}[n] - \sum_{j}\epsilon_j (\langle\psi_j|\psi_j\rangle - 1)\Big\} = 0\,, for each $i$. Varying $\psi_i^$ yields: \frac{\delta T_s}{\delta \psi_i^(r)} + \int d^3r’\, \frac{\delta E_{\rm other}}{\delta n(r’)} \frac{\delta n(r’)}{\delta \psi_i^(r)} = \epsilon_i\,\psi_i(r)\,. Now, $\delta T_s/\delta \psi_i^* = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 \psi_i(r)$ (like a kinetic operator acting on $\psi_i$), and $\frac{\delta E_{\rm other}}{\delta n(r’)} = V_{\rm ext}(r’) + \frac{\delta E_{\rm H}}{\delta n(r’)} + \frac{\delta E_{\rm xc}}{\delta n(r’)}$.
Note $\frac{\delta E_{\rm H}}{\delta n(r’)} = \int d^3r’’, \frac{n(r’’)}{|r’-r’’|} = V_{\rm H}(r’)$, the Hartree potential, and by definition $\frac{\delta E_{\rm xc}}{\delta n(r’)} = V_{\rm xc}(r’)$, the exchange–correlation potential. Also, $\frac{\delta n(r’)}{\delta \psi_i^*(r)} = \psi_i(r)\delta(r-r’)$ (since $n = \sum_j |\psi_j|^2$). So the variational equation becomes: -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\psi_i(r) + \Big[V_{\rm ext}(r) + V_{\rm H}(r) + V_{\rm xc}(r)\Big]\psi_i(r) = \epsilon_i\, \psi_i(r)\,. This is the Kohn–Sham equation  , which has the form of a one-particle Schrödinger equation: \hat{H}{\rm KS}\psi_i(r) = \epsilon_i \psi_i(r)\,, where $\hat{H}{\rm KS} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V_{\rm eff}(r)$ and V_{\rm eff}(r) = V_{\rm ext}(r) + V_{\rm H}n + V_{\rm xc}n\,. This effective potential $V_{\rm eff}(r)$ depends on the density $n(r)$ through $V_{\rm H}$ and $V_{\rm xc}$ .
We have obtained a set of $N$ coupled one-particle equations. The couplings are implicit: all orbitals $\psi_i$ feel the same $V_{\rm eff}[n]$, and $V_{\rm eff}$ in turn depends on all $\psi_i$ via $n(r) = \sum_{j}|\psi_j|^2$. Thus, the KS equations must be solved self-consistently. 

!split
===== Interpreting the Kohn–Sham Equations =====

Self-consistent field (SCF): The KS equations $(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V_{\rm eff}n)\psi_i = \epsilon_i\psi_i$ look like independent-particle Schrödinger equations. However, $V_{\rm eff}(r)$ depends on $n(r)$, which in turn depends on all ${\psi_i}$. Solving them requires a self-consistent cycle: guess a density (or orbitals) $\rightarrow$ compute $V_{\rm eff}$ $\rightarrow$ solve for new $\psi_i$ $\rightarrow$ update $n(r)$ $\rightarrow$ repeat until convergence. (We will detail this algorithm in Lecture 4.)
Exchange–correlation potential: $V_{\rm xc}(r) = \delta E_{\rm xc}/\delta n(r)$ plays a central role. It includes all many-body effects such as exchange (Pauli exclusion) and electron correlation. In practice, $E_{\rm xc}[n]$ must be approximated. But if $E_{\rm xc}$ were known exactly, $V_{\rm xc}(r)$ ensures that the KS orbitals yield the correct $n(r)$ and energy.
Total energy expression: Once the KS equations are solved for the orbitals and eigenvalues, one can compute the total energy as E[n] = \sum_{i=1}^N \epsilon_i \;-\; \frac{1}{2}\int d^3r\, V_{\rm H}(r)\,n(r)\;+\; E_{\rm xc}[n] \;-\; \int d^3r\, n(r)\,V_{\rm xc}(r)\,. This formula corrects for the fact that $\sum_i \epsilon_i$ counts the Hartree energy and $E_{\rm xc}$ contributions in a non-double-counting way . It can be derived from the variation result and ensures adding $V_{\rm xc}$ term did not overcount those energies.
Physical meaning of $\epsilon_i$: The KS eigenvalues $\epsilon_i$ do not strictly equal the true excitation energies of the system (except in special cases). They are Lagrange multipliers to enforce orbital orthonormality. However, the highest occupied KS eigenvalue $\epsilon_{\rm HOMO}$ (for exact XC) equals the negative of the ionization energy by Janak’s theorem and the Koopmans’ theorem analogue in DFT. Also, differences $\epsilon_{i}-\epsilon_{j}$ often resemble quantum excitation energies (and in practice KS band structures often qualitatively match measured band structures, with notable systematic errors like band gap underestimation – more in Lecture 5).
Spin-generalization: Real systems have electron spin. Spin-DFT (or LSDA) extends KS to two densities: $n_\uparrow(r)$ and $n_\downarrow(r)$ for spin-up and spin-down electrons. The HK theorems generalize to spin densities, and one defines $E[n_\uparrow,n_\downarrow]$ with exchange-correlation functional $E_{\rm xc}[n_\uparrow,n_\downarrow]$. In practice, one often uses local spin-density approximation (LSDA) where $E_{\rm xc}$ depends on $n_\uparrow$ and $n_\downarrow$ locally. The KS equations split for each spin channel with their own $V_{\rm xc}^\uparrow$ and $V_{\rm xc}^\downarrow$. Exchange energy, for example, is computed separately for each spin as it involves like-spin correlations .
Summary: The Kohn–Sham formulation reduces the interacting $N$-electron problem to $N$ one-electron equations, provided we have a good approximation for $E_{\rm xc}[n]$. This was a monumental shift – it allows using basis sets and algorithms from one-particle quantum mechanics (like plane waves, etc.) to handle many-electron systems with reasonable cost.

===== The Exchange–Correlation Functional $E_{\xc}[n]$ =====

$E_{\xc}[n]$ is the heart of DFT approximations. It encodes all the many-body quantum effects beyond the simple Hartree picture and non-interacting kinetic energy. By definition: \[ E_{\xc}[n] = (T[n] - T_s[n]) + (V_{\rm int}[n] - E_{\rm H}[n])\,, \] which includes: – Exchange energy $E_x[n]$: the part arising from Pauli exclusion (present even in Hartree–Fock). – Correlation energy $E_c[n]$: the remaining part due to electron-electron dynamical correlations (not captured by a single Slater determinant).
The exact $E_{\xc}[n]$ is unknown except for simple model systems. We rely on approximate forms. Despite the word “exchange-correlation”, standard DFT approximations do not treat exchange and correlation separately; rather $E_{\xc}$ is an integrated functional typically constructed with certain properties in mind (sum rules, known limits, etc.).
Key properties of $E_{\xc}[n]$ (exact functional): 
$E_{\xc}$ is typically negative (exchange is negative, lowering energy; correlation usually negative as well for bound systems).
It has a corresponding potential $V_{\xc}(\mathbf{r}) = \delta E_{\xc}/\delta n(\mathbf{r})$. This $V_{\xc}$ ensures the KS orbitals yield the correct $n(\mathbf{r})$.
$E_{\xc}$ accounts for things like the exchange hole (the reduced probability of finding another electron near a given electron due to Pauli principle) and the correlation hole (avoidance due to Coulomb repulsion).
There is an important sum rule: the exchange hole integrated over space gives $-1$ electron (each electron excludes one charge of same-spin density around it).

Because the exact functional is intractable, we build approximations in a systematic way (sometimes called “Jacob’s ladder” of DFT approximations, from simplest to more complex forms).


!split
===== Local Density Approximation (LDA) =====

LDA formulation: The local density approximation is the first and simplest rung of approximations. In LDA, one assumes the XC energy at point $\mathbf{r}$ depends only on the local density $n(\mathbf{r})$. Specifically, \[ E_{\xc}^{\rm LDA}[n] = \int d^3r\, n(\mathbf{r})\, \varepsilon_{\xc}\!\big(n(\mathbf{r})\big)\,, \] where $\varepsilon_{\xc}(n)$ is the XC energy per electron of a uniform electron gas of density $n$. So essentially, LDA treats each point in the material as if it were part of a homogeneous electron gas with that local density.
Origin: The homogeneous electron gas (HEG) is one of the rare many-body systems we can solve (with quantum Monte Carlo, etc.). For a given uniform density $n$, the exchange energy per electron is known analytically (Dirac, 1930): \varepsilon_x(n) = -\frac{3}{4}\left(\frac{3}{\pi}\right)^{1/3} \frac{e^2 n^{1/3}}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \quad \text{(in SI units, or = $-0.458\, r_s^{-1}$ Ry in atomic units)}. The correlation energy per electron $\varepsilon_c(n)$ was tabulated via Monte Carlo by Ceperley and Alder (1980) and fit by Perdew–Zunger (1981) – providing a practical formula for $\varepsilon_c(n)$ for all densities.
Successes of LDA: In the 1970s–80s, LDA proved surprisingly successful for solids and simple metals. It tends to give reasonably good electron densities and total energies, often canceling errors between exchange and correlation. For many solids, LDA predicts lattice constants within a few percent of experiment and bulk modulus within ~10%. For example, LDA for silicon gives a lattice constant slightly smaller than experiment (overbinding), but within ~1-2% .
Systematic errors: LDA, however, is not very accurate for molecules (it overbinds molecules by about 1 eV per bond on average ). It also underestimates bond lengths (making them too short) and overestimates vibrational frequencies. In extended systems, LDA typically underestimates band gaps of semiconductors (often giving 30-50% smaller gaps or even falsely predicting a metallic state for some insulators).
Why LDA works or fails: LDA has no knowledge of density gradients or molecule-specific effects. It works best when the system’s density varies slowly or is close to homogeneous (like simple metals). It fails when density is highly inhomogeneous or when delicate bonding/angle preferences occur (where gradients matter) or in systems where long-range correlation (van der Waals) is important, since a uniform-gas approximation can’t capture those. 

!split
===== Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) =====

Inclusion of density gradients: The next rung beyond LDA are GGA functionals. These include dependence not only on $n(\mathbf{r})$ but also on its gradient $\nabla n(\mathbf{r})$. The general form is: \[ E_{\xc}^{\rm GGA}[n] = \int f\big(n(\mathbf{r}), \nabla n(\mathbf{r})\big)\, d^3r\,, \] where $f$ is some chosen function designed to satisfy known physical constraints. GGAs effectively recognize that the electron density varies in space and attempt to correct LDA by including gradient information (e.g., regions where density is rapidly changing like in molecular bonds or surfaces).
Popular GGA functionals: One prominent example is the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) GGA (1996) which is a non-empirical functional built to satisfy certain exact constraints and known limits. Others include BLYP (Becke exchange + Lee-Yang-Parr correlation) which is popular in quantum chemistry, PW91 (an earlier Perdew–Wang 1991 GGA), etc. In GGA, the exchange energy density is modified from the LDA form by a factor depending on the gradient $ = |\nabla n|/(2k_F n)$ (reduced gradient), and similarly correlation gets a gradient correction.
Improvements with GGA: GGAs generally improve upon LDA for molecules and complex materials: 
Molecular bonds: GGA (like PBE or BLYP) typically gives better bond energies and lengths than LDA. For example, LDA’s overbinding is reduced; GGAs give bond lengths usually within 1$\%$ of experiment and correct the overbinding by a significant amount . Hydrogen bonds and weak interactions are still not perfect, but better than LDA .
Solids: GGA often over-corrects LDA’s tendencies: if LDA lattice constant was too small, GGA gives a slightly too large lattice constant. It’s observed that experimental lattice constants often lie between LDA (too low) and GGA (too high) . Bulk moduli are slightly underestimated in GGA (since the volume is larger).
Cohesive energies: GGA improves cohesive energy calculations for molecules and solids; LDA might overestimate cohesive energies (overbinding) while GGA brings them closer to experiment .

GGA limitations: 
They still miss long-range van der Waals forces (since those arise from non-local correlation, not captured by a semilocal functional). GGAs can err badly for systems like layered materials (graphite) or molecular crystals where dispersion is key.
They often still underestimate band gaps (though sometimes marginally better than LDA by a small amount).
Strongly correlated electron systems (e.g. Mott insulators, some transition metal oxides) are still poorly described (GGA often predicts them metallic unless an empirical $U$ correction is added).

Spin in LDA/GGA: In spin-polarized cases, one uses LSDA or GGA that are functions of $n_\uparrow, n_\downarrow$ (often constructed by applying LDA/GGA for each spin channel). This allows treatment of magnetism. For example, LSDA correctly predicts an exchange splitting in iron and a ferromagnetic ground state, though it may overestimate the magnetic moments slightly. 

!split
===== Beyond GGA: Meta-GGA and Hybrid Functionals =====

Meta-GGAs: These are functionals that include second derivatives or kinetic energy densities. For instance, a meta-GGA may use $n(\mathbf{r})$, $\nabla n$, and also the KS kinetic energy density $\tau(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_i \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}|\nabla \psi_i|^2$ or $\nabla^2 n$. Including $\tau$ helps the functional distinguish regions like bond versus slowly varying electron gas more effectively. An example is the SCAN functional (Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed, 2015) which is a meta-GGA that satisfies many known constraints and often achieves higher accuracy across diverse systems than typical GGA.
Hybrid functionals: These functionals mix a portion of exact exchange (from Hartree–Fock theory) with GGA exchange-correlation. The rationale is to mitigate the self-interaction error and correct the underestimated repulsion in LDA/GGA exchange. A general form: \[ E_{\xc}^{\rm hybrid} = E_{\xc}^{\rm GGA} + a \,(E_x^{\rm HF} - E_x^{\rm GGA})\,, \] where $E_x^{\rm HF}$ is the exact exchange energy from the KS orbitals (non-local), and $a$ is a mixing coefficient (commonly 20-2$5\%$). B3LYP is a famous hybrid in chemistry (with $a\approx 0.2$ plus some empirical parameters in correlation), and PBE0 is a hybrid with $a=0.25$ (25$\%$ exact exchange) based on PBE. Hybrids significantly improve molecular properties: they give much better reaction energy barriers, atomization energies, and often better equilibrium structures.
Why hybrids help: By adding exact exchange, hybrids correct the tendency of LDA/GGA to over-stabilize electron-rich regions. They also open up band gaps for insulators/semiconductors compared to LDA/GGA. For example, PBE (a GGA) predicts Si band gap ~0.6 eV while experiment is 1.1 eV; a hybrid like HSE (screened hybrid) or PBE0 might predict ~0.9–1.2 eV, much closer . In fact, the popular B3LYP functional was one reason DFT became widely used in quantum chemistry – it achieves “chemical accuracy” (~0.1 eV error) for many thermochemical properties  .
Cost of hybrids: The inclusion of exact exchange makes calculations more expensive (scaling roughly like Hartree–Fock, $O(N^4)$ with system size, rather than $O(N^3)$ for pure DFT). In extended systems (3D solids), exact exchange is particularly costly, though screened hybrids (like HSE06) make it more tractable by damping long-range exchange.
Empirical vs non-empirical: Some functionals (like B3LYP) had parameters fit to a training set of molecules, whereas PBE, SCAN, etc., are “non-empirical” (built from known physical constraints). Both approaches exist; empirical functionals can sometimes be very accurate for the types of systems they were fit to but might be less transferable.
Functional performance: Over the decades, improvement is incremental. For instance, GGA significantly improved over LDA by late 1980s ; hybrids in the 1990s improved further. Yet some problems remain challenging (van der Waals, strong correlation). Many newer functionals aim at specialized fixes (like DFT-D for dispersion, DFT+U for correlations – to be discussed below).
