===== Density functional theory =====


Hohenberg and Kohn proved that the total energy of a system including
that of the many-body effects of electrons (exchange and correlation)
in the presence of static external potential (for example, the atomic
nuclei) is a unique functional of the charge density. The minimum
value of the total energy functional is the ground state energy of the
system. The electronic charge density which yields this minimum is
then the exact single particle ground state energy.


!split
===== Functional of density  =====


The electronic energy $E$ is said to be a functional of the
electronic density, $E[\rho]$, in the sense that for a given function
$\rho(r)$, there is a single corresponding energy. The
Hohenberg-Kohn theorems (two) confirms that such a functional exists,
but does not tell us the form of the functional.

Density functional theory has turned out to be a resounding success. A
large majority of crystalline materials, many molecules and molecular
structures have been explained using DFT. Walter Kohn, involved in
both the Hohenberg-Kohn theory and development of the Kohn-Sham
equations, received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for DFT and
computational chemistry in 1998.  DFT is used in a broad spectrum of
disciplines, including quantum chemistry, materials science, condensed
matter physics and low-energy nuclear physics



!split
===== The many-particle equation =====

Any material on earth, whether in crystals, amorphous solids,
molecules or yourself, consists of nothing else than a bunch of atoms,
ions and electrons bound together by electric forces. All these
possible forms of matter can be explained by virtue of one simple
equation: the many-particle Schr\"{o}dinger equation,

!bt
\begin{equation}
	i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Phi( \bm{r} ; t) = 
	\left( - \sum_{i}^N \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_i} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \bm{r}_i^2}
	+ \sum_{i<j}^N \frac{e^2 Z_i Z_j }{ | \bm{r}_i - \bm{r}_j| } \right)  \Phi( \bm{r} ; t).
\end{equation}
!et

Here $\Phi(\bm{r} ; t)$ is the many-body wavefunction for $N$ particles, where each particle has its own mass $m_i$, charge $Z_i$ and position $\bm{r}_i$. The only interaction is the Coulomb interaction $e^2/r$. 


!split
===== Born-Oppenheimer approximation =====

In atomic and molecular physics, materials science and quantum chemsitry, the Born-Oppenheimer  approximation arises from the physical problem we want to
study: the ground state of a collection of interacting ions and
electrons. Because even the lightest ion is more than a thousand times
heavier than an electron, we approximate our Hamiltonian  to not include  the dynamics of the
ions all-together. This is known as the _Born-Oppenheimer_
approximation.


!split
===== Time-independent equation =====

We then write the time-independent Schr\"{o}dinger
equation for a collection of $N$ electrons subject to the
electric potential created by the fixed ions, labeled $v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\bm{r})$,

!bt
\[
	\left( \sum_{i}^N \left( - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \bm{r}_i^2}
	+ v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\bm{r}_i) \right)
	 + \sum_{i<j}^N \frac{e^2}{|\bm{r}_i - \bm{r}_j|} \right) \Psi(\bm{r}) = E_0  \Psi( \bm{r} ),
\]
!et
where $\bm{r}_i$ are the positions of the electrons.

We can replace the explicit Coulomb repulsion with a generic two-body interaction
!bt
\[
	\sum_{i}^N \left( - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \bm{r}_i^2}
	+ v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\bm{r}_i) \right)
	 + \sum_{i<j}^N v(r_{ij})( = E_0  \Psi( \bm{r} ),
\]
!et
where $r_{ij}=\vert \bm{r}_i-\bm{r}_j\vert$. 


!split
===== Potential term =====
The potential
$v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\bm{r}_i)$ is created by the charged ions,
!bt
\[
	v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\bm{r}_i) = - \sum_j \frac{e^2 Z_j}{| \bm{r}_i - \bm{R}_j|}
\]
!et
where $\bm{R}$ is the (static) positions of the ions and $Z_j$ their
charge.


!split
===== The one-body density =====
The one-body reduced density matrix of a many-body system at zero
temperature gives direct access to many observables, such as the charge density,
kinetic energy and occupation numbers. In a coordinate representation it is defined as
as the expectation value of the number operator
!bt
\[
\hat{n}(\bm{r})=\sum_{i=1}^N\delta(\bm{r}-\bm{r}_i),
\]
!et
resulting in 
!bt
\[
n(\bm{r})=\frac{\langle \Psi \vert \hat{n}(\bm{r}) \vert \Psi \rangle}{\langle \Psi\vert \Psi \rangle}.
\]
!et

Here $\Psi$ can be any state. In the equations that follow we assume it has been normalized properly.


!split
===== One-body density  =====

The one-body or just electronic density here, is thus obtained by integrating out all electron
degrees of freedom except one, that is (setting $\bm{r}=\bm{r}_1$)
!bt
\[
	n(\bm{r})=n(\bm{r}_1) = \int d^3 \bm{r}_2 \cdots d^3 \bm{r}_N
		\left| \Psi (\bm{r}_1 \cdots \bm{r}_n) \right|^2.
\]
!et

If $\Psi$ is a single reference Slater determinant defined in terms of the single-particle functions $\psi_i$, then we have 
!bt
\[
	n(\bm{r})=\sum_{i=1}^N\vert \psi_i(\bm{r})\vert^2,
\]
!et
as derived earlier. 

!split
===== Energy as function of the density =====

Text to come here.

!split
===== Hohenberg-Kohn theory =====

Assume we found a solution for the Hamiltonian from the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, with
ground state energy $E_0$ and a certain electronic density
$n(\bm{r})$. The strength of the Coulomb interaction and the mass of an
electron are constants of nature, so the only input that can possibly
influence the electronic density $n(\bm{r})$ and the energy $E_0$ of our
ground state is our choice of potential $v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\bm{r})$. In other words, the
ground state energy is a {\em functional} of the input potential,

!bt
\[
E_0 [v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\bm{r})] = \mathcal{F}_E[ v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\bm{r}) ]
\]
!et


!split
===== Energy functional =====
A functional is nothing else than a function whose input is another
function; in this case the functional $\mathcal{F}$ takes as input the
electric potential generated by the ions and outputs the ground state
energy based on thr Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

At first this results seems counterintuitive. After all, the ground
state energy clearly contains the kinetic energy $T$, the interaction
energy $U$ and the potential energy. Only the latter term 
explicitly depends on the potential. We can thus write the ground
state energy in terms of a separate functional for the kinetic and
interaction energy, and the potential energy


!split
===== How to find the functional =====
Knowing this functional, for any given potential $V(\bm{r})$ we minimize
the right hand side by checking all possible electronic density
distributions.


There are only two minor problems. We don't know what this functional
looks like. And even if we did, we don't know how to find the right
electronic density.

!split
===== Approximating the functional =====

The unknown functional $\mathcal{F}[n(\bm{r})]$ should describe the
kinetic and interaction energy of a system described by
for example the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Even though we cannot find its exact
shape, we can look at its shape in some limiting cases that we can
solve.

We know that a free homogeneous electron gas (HEG) with density $n$ has a
ground state energy of
!bt
\[
E_0 = \frac{3 \hbar^2 \left( 3 \pi^2 \right)^{2/3}}{10 m} n_0^{5/3}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Using the results from the HEG =====

For a slowly varying electronic density, we can approximate the
kinetic energy contribution to the full functional
$\mathcal{F}[n(\bm{r})]$ as the energy evaluated
at each point separately,

!bt
\[
	\mathcal{T}_0 [n(\bm{r})] =
	 \frac{3 \hbar^2 \left( 3 \pi^2 \right)^{2/3}}{10 m} \int  d^3\bm{r} ( n(\bm{r}) )^{5/3}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Hartree term to the energy =====

We have also earlier derived that the simplest 
energy contribution from Coulomb interactions is given by the Hartree
term

!bt
\[
	\mathcal{U}_{\mathrm{H}} [n(\bm{r})] = 
		\frac{e^2}{2} \int d^3\bm{r} d^3\bm{r}' \, \frac{n(\bm{r}) n(\bm{r}')}{|\bm{r} - \bm{r}'|}.
\]
!et


!split
===== Final functional =====

It is natural to write out the full functional as containing the
homogeneous electron gas term and the Hartree term. The remaining
terms, though still unknown, should be small. This unknown part is
conventionally called the {\em exchange-correlation potential}
$E_{xc}[n(\bm{r})]$. The full Hohenberg-Kohn functional, including the
potential energy, is thus

!bt
\[
	\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{HK}}[n(\bm{r})] = 
		\mathcal{T}_0 [n(\bm{r})]
		 + \int d^3 \bm{r} v_{\mathrm{ext}}(r) n(\bm{r})
		 + \mathcal{U}_{\mathrm{H}} [n(\bm{r})]
		 + E_{xc} [ n(\bm{r})].
\]
!et

!split
===== Kohn-Sham equation =====

We replaced an intractable problem with the task of minimizing an unknown
functional $\mathcal{F}[n(\bm{r})]$ over infinitely many possible
electronic densities $n(\bm{r})$. In the previous section we already gave
some first suggestions for the functional. But once we found it, how
to find the right electronic density $n(\bm{r})$?

Because the correct density minimizes the functional, we can find the
functional by setting it's derivative to zero,

!bt
\[
	\frac{\delta \mathcal{F}[n(\bm{r})] }{\delta n(\bm{r})} = 0.
\]
!et


!split
===== Kohn-Sham equations =====
Using the functional Eq(insert), we write
out

#\footnote{There is a small subtlety included in this equation: the
#kinetic component of the functional $\mathcal{T} [n(\bm{r})]$ should not
#be the one obtained for the free homogeneous noninteracting electron
#gas, but the one for a noninteracting gas subject
#to the Kohn-Sham potential.}

!bt
\[
	\frac{\delta \mathcal{T}[n(\bm{r})] }{\delta n(\bm{r})}
	+ v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\bm{r})
	+ \int \frac{n(\bm{r}')}{|\bm{r}-\bm{r}'|}d^3 \bm{r}'
	+ \frac{\delta E_{xc} [n(\bm{r})] }{\delta n(\bm{r})}
	=0.
\]
!et

!split
===== The equations =====
The idea of Kohn and Sham was to treat this as if it
is a single-particle problem. The first term represents the
kinetic energy, and the remaining terms form the Kohn-Sham potential

!bt
\[
	V_{\mathrm{KS}}(\bm{r}) = V(\bm{r})
	+ \int \frac{n(\bm{r}')}{|\bm{r}-\bm{r}'|}d^3 \bm{r}'
	+ \frac{\delta E_{xc} [n(\bm{r})] }{\delta n(\bm{r})}.
\]
!et
The Kohn-Sham equation is the single-particle Schr\"{o}dinger
equation with the potential given by the last equation,

!bt
\[
	\left( - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial \bm{r}^2} + V_{\mathrm{KS}}(\bm{r}) \right) \psi_i(\bm{r}) = \epsilon_i \psi_i (\bm{r}).
\]
!et

!split
===== Numerical solution =====

The Kohn-Sham equations have to be solved numerically. As with our
discussions of Hartree-Fock theory, this is tractable because the
equations are just given by a set of coupled differential
equation. The electronic density is obtained by occupying the $N$
solutions $\psi_i(\bm{r})$ with the lowest energy,

!bt
\[
	n(\bm{r}) = \sum_{i=1}^N |\psi_i (\bm{r}) |^2.
\]
!et

Now the electronic density obtained this way can be used to calculate
a new Kohn-Sham potential. We
continue this iterative procedure until we reach convergence.

===== Density Functional Theory (DFT) =====

Hohenberg and Kohn proved that the total energy of a system including that of the many-body 
effects of electrons (exchange and correlation) in the presence of static external potential (for example, the atomic nuclei) 
is a unique functional of the charge density. The minimum value of the total energy functional 
is the ground state energy of the system. The electronic charge density which yields this 
minimum is then the exact single particle ground state energy.

In Hartree-Fock theory  one works with large basis sets. This
poses a problem for large systems. An alternative to the HF methods is
DFT. DFT  takes into 
account electron correlations but is less demanding computationally
than full scale diagonalization, Coupled Cluster theory or say Monte Carlo methods.

!split
===== Density Functional Theory, definitions, onebody density =====

The one-body density in coordinate space is defined as 
!bt
\[
\rho({\bf r}) = \sum_{i=1}^N \delta({\bf r}-{\bf r}_i).
\]
!et
In second quantization this becomes
!bt
\[
\hat{\rho}({\bf r}) = \sum_{\alpha\beta}^{\infty}\rho_{\alpha,\beta}({\bf r}) a^{\dagger}_{\alpha}a_{\beta}.
\]
!et
where 
!bt
\[
\rho_{\alpha,\beta}({\bf r})= \psi^*_{\alpha}({\bf r})\psi_{\beta}({\bf r}).
\]
!et
!split
===== Density Functional Theory, definitions, onebody density =====

The number of particles is $N$ and the integral of the expectation value of the one-body density operator should give you $N$ particles. 
With an appropriate similarity transformation we can make this operator diagonal in the single-particle basis $\psi_{\alpha}$. 
That is
!bt
\[
\hat{\rho}({\bf r}) = \sum_{\alpha=1}^{\infty} |\psi_{\alpha}({\bf r})|^2a^{\dagger}_{\alpha}a_{\alpha}=
\hat{\rho}({\bf r}) = \sum_{\alpha=1}^{\infty}\rho_{\alpha\alpha}({\bf r}) a^{\dagger}_{\alpha}a_{\alpha}.
\]
!et
The ground state wave function $|\Psi_0\rangle$ is a linear combination of all $D$ possible Slater determinants 
$|\Phi_i\rangle$
!bt
\[
|\Psi_0\rangle=\sum_{i=1}^DC_{0i}|\Phi_i\rangle,
\]
!et
where the  coefficients $C_{0i}$ could arise from an FCI calculation using a given Slater determinant basis 
!bt
\[
|\Phi_i\rangle = a^{\dagger}_1a^{\dagger}_2\dots a^{\dagger}_N |0\rangle. 
\]
!et
!split
===== Density Functional Theory, definitions, onebody density =====

The ground state expectation value of the one-body density operator is
!bt
\[
\langle\hat{\rho}({\bf r})\rangle = \langle \Psi_0|\sum_{\alpha=1}^{\infty} \rho_{\alpha,\alpha}({\bf r})a^{\dagger}_{\alpha}a_{\alpha}|\Psi_0\rangle,
\]
!et
which translates into
!bt
\[
\langle\hat{\rho}({\bf r})\rangle = \sum_{ij=1}^DC^*_{0i}C_{0j}\langle \Phi_i|\sum_{\alpha=1}^{\infty} \rho_{\alpha,\alpha}({\bf r})a^{\dagger}_{\alpha}a_{\alpha}|\Phi_j\rangle.
\]
!et
Integrating
!bt
\[
\int \langle\hat{\rho}({\bf r})\rangle d {\bf r},
\]
!et
gives us $N$, the number of particles!

!split
===== Density Functional Theory, definitions, twobody density =====

The two-body densities is a simple extension of the one-body density
!bt
\[
\rho({\bf r}_1, {\bf r}_2) = \sum_{ij=1}^N \delta({\bf r}_1-{\bf r}_i)\delta({\bf r}_2-{\bf r}_j),
\]
!et
which in second quantization becomes
!bt
\[
\hat{\rho}({\bf r}_1, {\bf r}_2) = \sum_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}^{\infty}\rho_{\alpha,\gamma}({\bf r}_1)\rho_{\beta,\delta}({\bf r}_2)a^{\dagger}_{\alpha}a^{\dagger}_{\beta}a_{\delta}a_{\gamma},
\]
!et
meaning that the ground-state two-body density is 
!bt
\[
\langle\hat{\rho}({\bf r}_1, {\bf r}_2) \rangle = \sum_{ij=1}^DC^*_{0i}C_{0j}\langle \Phi_i|\sum_{\alpha\beta\gamma\delta}^{\infty}\rho_{\alpha,\gamma}({\bf r}_1)\rho_{\beta,\delta}({\bf r}_2)a^{\dagger}_{\alpha}a^{\dagger}_{\beta}a_{\delta}a_{\gamma}  |\Phi_j\rangle.
\]
!et
!split
===== Hartree-Fock equations and density matrix =====

The Hartree-Fock algorithm can be broken down as follows. We recall that  our Hartree-Fock matrix  is 
!bt
\[
\hat{h}_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}=\langle \alpha \vert\hat{h}_0 \vert \beta \rangle+
\sum_{j=1}^N\sum_{\gamma\delta} C^*_{j\gamma}C_{j\delta}\langle \alpha\gamma|V|\beta\delta\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
Normally we assume that the single-particle basis $\vert\beta\rangle$
forms an eigenbasis for the operator $\hat{h}_0$, meaning that the
Hartree-Fock matrix becomes
!bt
\[
\hat{h}_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}=\epsilon_{\alpha}\delta_{\alpha,\beta}+
\sum_{j=1}^N\sum_{\gamma\delta} C^*_{j\gamma}C_{j\delta}\langle \alpha\gamma|V|\beta\delta\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
!split
===== Hartree-Fock equations and density matrix =====

The Hartree-Fock eigenvalue problem
!bt
\[
\sum_{\beta}\hat{h}_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}C_{i\beta}=\epsilon_i^{\mathrm{HF}}C_{i\alpha},
\]
!et
can be written out in a more compact form as
!bt
\[
\hat{h}^{HF}\hat{C}=\epsilon^{\mathrm{HF}}\hat{C}. 
\]
!et
!split
===== Hartree-Fock equations and density matrix =====

The equations are often rewritten in terms of a so-called density matrix,
which is defined as 

!bt
\[
\rho_{\gamma\delta}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\langle\gamma|i\rangle\langle i|\delta\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{N}C_{i\gamma}C^*_{i\delta}.
\]
!et
It means that we can rewrite the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian as
!bt
\[
\hat{h}_{\alpha\beta}^{HF}=\epsilon_{\alpha}\delta_{\alpha,\beta}+
\sum_{\gamma\delta} \rho_{\gamma\delta}\langle \alpha\gamma|V|\beta\delta\rangle_{AS}.
\]
!et
It is convenient to use the density matrix since we can precalculate in every iteration the product of two eigenvector components $C$. 


Note that $\langle \alpha\vert\hat{h}_0\vert\beta \rangle$ denotes the
matrix elements of the one-body part of the starting hamiltonian.

!split
===== Density Functional Theory =====

The electronic energy $E$ is said to be a \emph{functional} of the
electronic density, $E[\rho]$, in the sense that for a given function
$\rho(r)$, there is a single corresponding energy. The  
\emph{Hohenberg-Kohn theorem} confirms that such
a functional exists, but does not tell us the form of the
functional. As shown by Kohn and Sham, the exact ground-state energy
$E$ of an $N$-electron system can be written as

!bt
\[
  E[\rho] = -\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^N\int
  \Psi_i^*(\mathbf{r_1})\nabla_1^2 \Psi_i(\mathbf{r_1}) d\mathbf{r_1}
  - \int \frac{Z}{r_1} \rho(\mathbf{r_1}) d\mathbf{r_1} +
  \frac{1}{2} \int\frac{\rho(\mathbf{r_1})\rho(\mathbf{r_2})}{r_{12}}
  d\mathbf{r_1}d\mathbf{r_2} + E_{XC}[\rho]
\]
!et
with $\Psi_i$ the \emph{Kohn-Sham} (KS) \emph{orbitals}.
Note that we have limited ourselves to atomic physics here.

How do we arrive at the above equation? 

!split
===== Density Functional Theory =====

The ground-state charge density is given by
!bt
\[
  \rho(\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{i=1}^N|\Psi_i(\mathbf{r})|^2, 
\]
!et
where the sum is over the occupied Kohn-Sham orbitals. The last term,
$E_{XC}[\rho]$, is the \emph{exchange-correlation energy} which in
theory takes into account all non-classical electron-electron
interaction. However, we do not know how to obtain this term exactly,
and are forced to approximate it. The KS orbitals are found by solving
the \emph{Kohn-Sham equations}, which can be found by applying a
variational principle to the electronic energy $E[\rho]$. This approach
is similar to the one used for obtaining the HF equation.

!split
===== Density Functional Theory =====

The KS equations reads
!bt
\[
  \left\{ -\frac{1}{2}\nabla_1^2 - \frac{Z}{r_1} + \int 
  \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r_2})}{r_{12}} d\mathbf{r_2} +
  V_{XC}(\mathbf{r_1}) \right\} \Psi_i(\mathbf{r_1}) =
  \epsilon_i \Psi_i(\mathbf{r_1})
\]
!et
where $\epsilon_i$ are the KS orbital energies, and where the 
\emph{exchange-correlation potential} is given by

!bt
\[
  V_{XC}[\rho] = \frac{\delta E_{XC}[\rho]}{\delta \rho}.
\]
!et
!split
===== Density Functional Theory =====

The KS equations are solved in a self-consistent fashion. A variety of
basis set functions  can be used, and the experience gained in HF
calculations are often useful. The computational time needed for a DFT
calculation formally scales as the third power of the number of basis
functions. 

The main source of error in DFT usually arises from the approximate
nature of $E_{XC}$. In the \emph{local density approximation} (LDA) it
is approximated as
!bt
\[
  E_{XC} = \int \rho(\mathbf{r})\epsilon_{XC}[\rho(\mathbf{r})]
  d\mathbf{r},
\]
!et
where $\epsilon_{XC}[\rho(\mathbf{r})]$ is the exchange-correlation
energy per electron in a homogeneous electron gas of constant density.
The LDA approach is clearly an approximation as the charge is not
continuously distributed. To account for the inhomogeneity of the
electron density, a nonlocal correction involving the gradient of
$\rho$ is often added to the exchange-correlation energy.

!split
===== The Hohenberg-Kohn theorems =====

Assume we have a given Hamiltonian for a  many-fermion system
!bt
\[
\hat{H} = \hat{T}+\hat{V}_{\mathrm{ext}}+\hat{V},
\]
!et
or in second quantized form

!bt
\begin{eqnarray}
\lefteqn{ \hat{H} = -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\int d^{3}r\hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}(\mathbf{r})\nabla^{2}\hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r})+\int d^{3}r\hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}(\mathbf{r})v_{\mathrm{ext}}(\mathbf{r})\hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r}) } \nonumber\\
& & {}+\frac{1}{2}\int d^{3}r\int d^{3}r'\hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}(\mathbf{r})\hat{\Psi}^{\dagger}(\mathbf{r'}) v(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r'})\hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r'})\hat{\Psi}(\mathbf{r}),\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
!et

\[

\]
!et
!bt
\]
    \hat{\Psi}^{\dagger }(\mathbf{r})\equiv \sum_{\mathbf{k}}\psi_{\mathbf{k}}^{*}(\mathbf{r})a_{\mathbf{k}}^{\dagger } \nonumber
\]
!et

$\mathbf{k} = $ collection of quantum numbers

!bt
\begin{align}
  \hat{T} &= \text{kinetic energy operator} \nonumber \\
  \hat{V}_{\mathrm{ext}} &= \text{external single-particle potential operator} \nonumber \\
  \hat{V} &= \text{two-particle interaction operator} \nonumber
\end{align}
!et

!split
===== Theorem I =====

We assume that there is a
$\mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{ext}} =$ set of external single-particle \alert{potentials} $v$ so that
!bt
\begin{equation}
\hat{H}\ket{\phi} = \left(\hat{T}+\hat{V}_{\mathrm{ext}}+\hat{V}\right)=E\ket{\phi},\qquad \hat{V}_{\mathrm{ext}}\in \mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{ext}},\nonumber
\end{equation} 
!et
gives a \alert{non-degenerate} N-particle ground state $\ket{\Psi }_0$.
For any system of interacting particles in an external potential 
$\mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{ext}}$, the potential $\mathcal{V}_{\mathrm{ext}}$ is uniquely 
determined (by a near constant) by the ground state density $\rho_0$.
There is a corollary to this statement which states that since $\hat{H}$ is determined, the many-body functions for all states are also determined. All properties of the system are determined via $\rho_0$.

!split
===== Theorem II =====

The density (assuming normalized state vectors)
!bt
\begin{equation}
  \rho(\mathbf{r})=\sum_{i}\int dx_{2}\dots \int dx_{N}\vert \Psi(\mathbf{r},x_{2},\dots ,x_{N})\vert^{2} \nonumber
\end{equation}
!et
Theorem II states that a universal functional for the energy $E[\rho]$ (function of $\rho$) can be defined for every external potential
$\mathcal{U}_{\mathrm{ext}}$. For a given external potential, the exact ground state energy of the system is a global minimum of this functional. The density which minimizes this functional is $\rho_0$.

===== Computing $E_{XC}$ from {\em ab initio} calculations =====

Question: can we compute the 'exact' $E_{XC}$ that enters DFT calculations? Yes! 

Let us define a continuous variable $\lambda$ and a Hamiltonian which depends on this variable
\[
\hat{H}_{\lambda}=\hat{T}+\lambda \hat{V}+\hat{v}_{\mathrm{ext}},
\]
where $\hat{T}$ is the kinetic energy, $\hat{V}$ is in our case the Coulomb interaction between two electrons an $\hat{v}_{\mathrm{ext}}$ is our external potential, here the two-dimensional
harmonic oscillator potential. 

For $\lambda=0$ we have the non-interacting system, whose solution in our case is a single
Slater determinant for the ground state (non-degenerate case). For $\lambda=1$ we
have the full interacting case. 


!split
===== Computing $E_{XC}$ from {\em ab initio} calculations =====

The standard variational principle is to find the minimum of 
\[
E_{\lambda}[\hat{v}_{\mathrm{ext}}]=\inf_{\Psi\rightarrow\rho}\langle \Psi_{\lambda}|\hat{H}_{\lambda}|\Psi_{\lambda}\rangle,
\]
with respect to the wave function $\Psi_{\lambda}$.  If a maximizing potential 
$\hat{v}_{\mathrm{ext}}^{\lambda}$ exists, then according  to the Hohenberg and Kohn, it is the one which has the density $\rho$ as the ground state density and we have a functional
\[
F_{\lambda}[\rho] = E_{\lambda}[\hat{v}_{\mathrm{ext}}^{\lambda}]
-\int d{\bf r}\rho({\bf r}) \hat{v}_{\mathrm{ext}}^{\lambda}({\bf r}).
\]

!split
===== Computing $E_{XC}$ from {\em ab initio} calculations =====

Which leads to the Lieb variational principle 
\[
F_{\lambda}[\rho] = \sup_{\hat{v}_{\mathrm{ext}}}\left(E_{\lambda}[\hat{v}_{\mathrm{ext}}^{\lambda}]
-\int d{\bf r}\rho({\bf r}) \hat{v}_{\mathrm{ext}}^{\lambda}({\bf r})\right).
\]
We define
\[
F_{\lambda}[\rho]= \langle \Psi_{\lambda}|\hat{T}+\lambda \hat{V}|\Psi_{\lambda}\rangle,
\]
which we rewrite as
\[
F_{\lambda}[\rho]= \langle \Psi_{\lambda}|\hat{T}|\Psi_{\lambda}\rangle+\lambda J[\rho]+E_{XC}[\rho],
\]
with the standard Hartree term
\[
J= \frac{1}{2}\int d{\bf r}_1d{\bf r}_2\rho({\bf r}_1)\rho({\bf r}_2)V(r_{12}).
\]

!split
===== Computing $E_{XC}$ from {\em ab initio} calculations =====

We want to find $E_{XC}[\rho]$ in
\[
F_{\lambda}[\rho]= \langle \Psi_{\lambda}|\hat{T}|\Psi_{\lambda}\rangle+\lambda J[\rho]+E_{XC}[\rho].
\]
To do this, since we use a variational method, we can employ the Hellmann-Feynman theorem,
which states that
\[
\Delta E = \int_{\lambda_1}^{\lambda_2}d\lambda \frac{\partial E_{\lambda}}{\partial \lambda} =
\int_{\lambda_1}^{\lambda_2}d\lambda \langle \Psi_{\lambda}|\frac{\partial\hat{H}_{\lambda}}{\partial \lambda}|\Psi_{\lambda}\rangle.
\]
Setting $\lambda_1=0$ and $\lambda_2=1$ we arrive at 
\[
\Delta E = \int_{0}^{1}d\lambda \langle \Psi_{\lambda}|\hat{V}|\Psi_{\lambda}\rangle,
\] 
where the wave function at $\lambda =0$ is our single Slater determinant for the reference state. In the case of a VMC caclulation there would be no Jastrow factor. For $\lambda=1$ we can use our best variational Monte Carlo function.  Note that $\hat{V}$
is the full interaction at $\lambda=1$!

!split
===== Computing $E_{XC}$ from {\em ab initio} calculations =====

We wish to relate 
\[
\Delta E = \int_{0}^{1}d\lambda\langle \Psi_{\lambda}|\hat{V}|\Psi_{\lambda}\rangle,
\] 
to $E_{XC}$. 
Recalling that we defined 
\[
\langle \Psi_{\lambda}|\lambda \hat{V}|\Psi_{\lambda}\rangle=\lambda J[\rho]+E_{XC}[\rho],
\]
we rewrite our equation as
\[
E_{XC}= \int_{0}^{1}d\lambda\langle \Psi_{\lambda}|\hat{W}_{\lambda}|\Psi_{\lambda}\rangle,
\] 
where 
\[
W_{\lambda}=\langle \Psi_{\lambda}|\lambda \hat{V}|\Psi_{\lambda}\rangle-J.
\]

!split
===== Computing $E_{XC}$ from {\em ab initio} calculations =====

Using the fundamental theorem of calculus we have then
\[
E_{XC}= \langle\Psi_{1}|\hat{V}|\Psi_{1}\rangle-\langle\Psi_{0}|\hat{V}|\Psi_{0}\rangle.
\]
We need thus simply to compute the expectation value of $\hat{V}$ for the single Slater
determinant $\lambda=0$ and the fully correlated wave 
function with, if we do a VMC calculation,  the Jastrow factor as well
for the $\lambda=1$ case.  

The total correlation energy, including kinetic energy is then (computed at a fixed density)
equal to
\[
E_C=\langle\Psi_{1}|\hat{T}+\hat{V}|\Psi_{1}\rangle-\langle\Psi_{0}|\hat{T}+\hat{V}|\Psi_{0}\rangle.
\]
