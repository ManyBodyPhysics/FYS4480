===== Friday's lecture =====
!bblock Friday:
o Presentation and discussion of second midterm
o Coupled Cluster theory
#  o Video of lecture at URL:"https://youtu.be/-2opFiQcZDk"
#  o Whiteboard notes at URL:"https://github.com/ManyBodyPhysics/FYS4480/blob/master/doc/HandwrittenNotes/2024/NotesNovember15.pdf"         
o Relevant reading for the lectures: Shavitt abd Bartlett chapters 6 and 7 on linked and unlinked diagrams. For coupled cluster theory chapter 9 is the most relevant one. The lectures follow to a large extent the material covered in these chapters.
