# Quantum mechanics for many-particle systems: a computational perspective

This course gives an introduction to the quantum mechanics of
many-body systems and the methods relevant for many-body problems in
such diverse areas as atomic, molecular, solid-state and nuclear
physics, chemistry and materials science. A theoretical understanding
of the behavior of quantum-mechanical many-body systems, that is,
systems containing many interacting particles - is a considerable
challenge in that, normally, no exact solution can be found.  Instead,
reliable methods are needed for approximate but accurate simulations
of such systems.

The aim of this course is to present some of the most widely used
many-body methods, starting with the underlying formalism of second
quantization. The topics covered include second quantization with
creation and annivilation operators, Wick's theorem, Feynman diagram
rules, microscopic mean-field theories (Hartree-Fock and Kohn-Sham
theories), many-body perturbation theory, large-scale diagonalization
methods, coupled cluster theory, algorithms from quantum computing,
and Green's function approaches. Both fermionic and bosonic systems
are discussed, depending on the interests of the participants.
Selected physical systems from various fields such as quantum
chemistry, solid-state physics and nuclear physics are studied,
depending on the background and interests of the participants.
